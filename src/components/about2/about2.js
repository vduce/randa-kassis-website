                <p>
                  My political beliefs have been shaped by a lifetime of intellectual rebellion,
                  activism, and deep engagement with history, philosophy, and the realities of
                  power. I reject all forms of ideological rigidity, recognising that dogma
                  regardless of its origin inevitably leads to oppression.
                </p>
                <p>
                  At my core, I believe in the primacy of individual freedom over collective
                  identity. I have devoted my life to challenging the dogmas that shape the Arab
                  world, advocating for a state that protects personal freedoms rather than
                  enforcing outdated moral codes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Yet I am not na√Øve about politics. The pursuit of a utopian system is futile;
                  history has shown that every ideological promise of salvation ends in
                  disillusionment. I believe instead in pragmatism seeking solutions that work,
                  adapting to realities without abandoning fundamental principles. Politics, like
                  life, is fluid, and those who fail to adapt are doomed to irrelevance.
