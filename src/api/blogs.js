      "an article exploring america's perceived role as global guardian, the persistence of binary thinking, and the illusion of moral supremacy.",
    des0: "As the crescendo of Ride of the Valkyries echoed and ground forces began advancing into Ukraine\u2014amid Western condemnation and threats of economic and military sanctions aimed at isolating Russia\u2014the West hoisted the banner of \u201cpride and resistance.\u201d",
    des1: "Zelensky appealed to Europe and the United States for unequivocal support, believing\u2014or perhaps merely hoping\u2014that America, in particular, would come to his rescue.",
    des2: "The Ukrainian president is not alone in regarding the United States as the ultimate guardian and sleepless sentinel, watching over its \u201cflock\u201d with unwavering vigilance. In this worldview, democracy is under its guardianship, and justice is its responsibility. This perspective is not exclusive to him; many across the globe share this vision. Just as some assume America\u2019s superiority, others see it as the enemy of peoples and nations\u2014a hegemonic power orchestrating conspiracies to dismantle governments that oppose its interests.",
    des3: "Hollywood\u2019s industrial-scale film production has only deepened this image, recasting the United States as a mythic hero in the imagination of some\u2014particularly those desperate to escape harsh realities. And so, reality blurs with longing, giving rise to the romanticism of the powerless.",
    des4: "This idea of American supremacy is not confined to those chasing the illusion of the \u201cAmerican dream\u201d; it extends equally to those who see the United States as a malevolent force, intent on crushing the aspirations of nations. Both sides, in their own way, reinforce the notion of a unipolar world, ignoring the emergence of other political, economic, and military powers\u2014and denying the reality of a multipolar global order.",
    des5: "The individual has long since surrendered to the notion of guardianship. In many societies, from birth, one falls under the authority of one\u2019s parents, only to be subsumed later by society, and then by the state. It is no surprise, then, that one ends up chasing the mirage of a modern-day \u201chero\u201d\u2014a figure shaped by fantasies and longings\u2014only to fall prey to propaganda.",
    des6: "This propaganda is by no means exclusive to the United States, but I highlight it here because of its vast cinematic machinery, which has fuelled its rise and prolonged its tiresome narrative\u2014one that no longer captures the imagination of any but the na\u00efve.",
    des7: "Many individuals and groups continue to suffer from binary thinking\u2014a legacy inherited from Plato, who equated justice with the health of the soul, and injustice with its illness. He laid the foundations of this dualistic framework, dividing the world into pairs: good and evil, justice and injustice, war and famine, health and disease, chaos and order, and so on.",
    des8: "Later philosophical traditions moved towards more pluralistic understandings, recognising the complex and multi-faceted nature of human psychology. Yet, even today, many cultures still rely heavily on binaries. Within them, the individual often retreats to a \u201cparadise\u201d of romantic elements\u2014constructs of imagined perfection.",
    des9: "For many, this paradise represents a sustained emotional or physical state, free of pain or injustice\u2014a realm of perpetual fairness, happiness, and tranquillity. And although some societies have managed to break free from the oppressive triad of power, granting broader rights to individuals and ensuring a greater degree of equality before the law, binary thinking still dominates. It prevails even among those engaged in public affairs.",
    des10:
      "It is clear that the implementation of justice in its \u201cfantastical\u201d sense remains, to this day, an impossibility\u2014incapable of aligning with the intricate nature of human behaviour, or of adapting to the multiplicity of cultures, political dynamics, military conflicts, or personal struggles. Binary thinking, then, is nothing more than a form of na\u00efve romanticism\u2014a delusion that many still insist on maintaining.",
    des11:
      "A brief glance at human history reveals a landscape riddled with conflict and primitive behaviours\u2014those which surface in times of war, famine, or existential threat.",
    des12:
      "From this, we can conclude that romantic idealism is an artificial construct\u2014alien to our nature. Humans do not inhabit a planet filled with cartoonish characters. Life is not a tidy dichotomy of good and evil, justice and injustice, peace and war, right and wrong. Rather, it is a complex entanglement of all these elements\u2014alongside countless others\u2014working together, however chaotically, in service of continuity.",

      "an article critiquing performative empathy and emotional sensationalism in modern digital and media cultures.",
    des0: "Over the past decade \u2014 ever since social media infiltrated nearly every home, bar, and street corner \u2014 we\u2019ve seen a surge in words and phrases (regardless of their linguistic merit or expressive depth), freely offered by their creators and generously rewarded by followers and online friends with medals of \u201chumanity.\u201d These medals, of course, are nothing more than symbolic gestures \u2014 emojis, empty phrases, and at best, dotless, hollow expressions.",
    des1: "Social networks have constructed a new social order \u2014 one partly driven by collective emotional exaggeration \u2014 giving rise to grand gestures, noble declarations, and what are touted as elevated \u201chuman values.\u201d But the foundation of these values lies in fantasy: a kind of escapist illusion that feeds an inflated \u201cgreat ego.\u201d And that ego is easily gratified \u2014 after all, such values demand no more than a few clich\u00e9d words or symbols.",
    des2: "We saw this flood of \u201chumanity\u201d in recent days with the tragic story of the Moroccan child, Rayan. No one denies the pain of the incident, especially for his family. But what invites reflection is the scale of the media coverage (I stress the word \u201cscale\u201d \u2014 we now live in an age of grand words, grand values, grand emotions), and the sweeping emotional response. It was, yet again, a race \u2014 a race to display the softest, most refined expressions of \u201chumanity,\u201d where individuals competed to earn the honorary badge of \u201ccivilisation.\u201d",
    des3: "Rayan died, and all of \u201chumanity\u201d mourned \u2014 wiping its tears, raising its hands in prayer, drained by its collective emotional labour. The child died, and \u201chumanity\u201d once more slipped into a coma, briefly awakened by his cries before returning to sleep.",
    des4: "And so, other children might rightly wonder what this \u201chumanity\u201d means for them \u2014 especially those whose deaths go unnoticed, perhaps because they perish in groups rather than as individuals. Children in Syria, Yemen, Libya, Iraq \u2014 dying in droves from hunger, cold, disease \u2014 do not qualify for such coverage. They are no longer \u201cnewsworthy.\u201d Nor are African children, some killed by tragic incidents \u2014 trampled by a hippo, or simply by poverty and lack of basic necessities. They, too, have become \u201cold stories.\u201d",
    des5: "None of these children can hope to inspire the kind of noble, global sentiment we recently witnessed. Because \u201chumanity,\u201d as it now functions, requires emotionally charged, individual stories. It cannot survive constant exposure to systemic suffering. To avoid emotional collapse, it must ration its sympathy.",
    des6: "So \u201chumanity,\u201d in its need for self-preservation, reveals itself in herd-like behaviour \u2014 crossing borders, fuelled by sensory globalisation. It performs empathy on demand.",
    des7: "And it\u2019s not only individuals. Television networks, too, compete: who can add the most pathos to the script? Which presenter can cry more believably, perform the most heartfelt gesture? Who can win the title of Most Human? It would not be surprising to one day see a televised contest called \u201cWho Will Win Humanity?\u201d",
    des8: "This race is pushing many rational individuals \u2014 those who respond thoughtfully and without affectation to tragedy \u2014 either into silence or into mimicking the herd, out of fear they\u2019ll be labelled \u201cinhuman.\u201d",
    des9: "Such uniform emotional reactions \u2014 disconnected from nature and blind to human diversity \u2014 ultimately pave the way for media authoritarianism. This, in turn, dulls the viewer\u2019s ability to feel and think. I do not exaggerate when I say that one-dimensional media can manufacture emotionally impaired human templates \u2014 models of \u201cideal\u201d selective compassion. We end up with a strange creature: a human being whose values and meanings are utterly confused.",
    des10:
      "This is not the first, nor will it be the last, tragic incident of its kind. Life overflows with daily personal catastrophes \u2014 and their coverage, if any, should be the responsibility of local media, nothing more.",
    des11:
      "A person who is truly conscious of life and death does not need to follow the crowd, nor become an echo, simply to prove they care. The amplified, theatrical emotions we now witness \u2014 steeped in hypocrisy and herd instinct \u2014 are no proof of anything. They reflect only a deep inability to generate change or to carve out new paths for humanity. They offer nothing more than melodrama, performed before a stone.",
    des12:
      "For years now, we\u2019ve heard endless talk of \u201cnew\u201d human values \u2014 limitless, borderless, all-embracing. Yet we remain caught in the same cycle of emojis, hashtags, and body language. Real values are not acrobatic displays, tearful theatrics, or reactive posturing. They are a form of sustained awareness \u2014 one that is neither fragmented nor conditioned by context.",

      "an article discussing the illusion of democracy and political movements in the Middle East, comparing them with historical examples.",
    des0: "Many mistakenly believe that tyranny is confined to autocratic rulers. In truth, it often conceals itself beneath the guise of reform and piety, preying on a population's yearning for change. From Renaissance Florence to the modern Middle East, the syndrome recurs — the faces change, but the structures of deception remain eerily familiar.",
    des1: "In the late fifteenth century, Girolamo Savonarola captivated a significant portion of Florence's population with his fervent sermons and alignment with the poor and disenfranchised. Promising a people's republic, he presented himself as a righteous preacher, condemning Rome and the Pope — whom he saw as the very embodiment of corruption.",
    des2: "Savonarola's rejection of art, poetry, and philosophy — which he deemed distractions from divine devotion — resonated with many, not only among the masses, but also among the opponents of Lorenzo the Magnificent, the famed patron of the arts under whose reign Florence flourished artistically, commercially, and architecturally.",
    des3: "Two years after Lorenzo's death, and following the flight of his son Piero during the French invasion of 1494, Savonarola managed to negotiate with King Charles VIII of France, securing the right for Florentines to choose their own government — a right previously reserved for a select elite.",
    des4: "Though this shift appeared democratic on the surface, in reality it ushered in a theocratic rule under Savonarola's iron grip. His reign, known as the \"years of darkness\", saw the burning of books, the destruction of Botticelli's paintings, and even the smashing of Michelangelo's sculptures.",
    des5: "It is difficult not to draw parallels between Savonarola's Florence — seduced by the illusion of democracy — and our own societies, which embraced revolutionary slogans without questioning the cultural foundations upon which real change must be built.",
    des6: "In more recent times, particularly following the uprisings across parts of the Middle East and North Africa, we witnessed a surge in political dissidents and human rights activists. Yet their conception of rights remained conditional, filtered through the lens of their own inherited cultural values.",
    des7: "They called for political freedom without first understanding its essence, or freeing it from the cultural strictures that constrain individual autonomy. In this, they differed little from the rulers they opposed — figures who, despite their lack of vision or competence, clung to power not through merit, but through inertia and the absence of alternatives.",
    des8: "Many of these rulers evoke the image of medieval monarchs. Take, for instance, Louis XI of France, who imprisoned his adversaries in narrow cages — a precursor to modern methods of repression, perfected by successors who crammed hundreds into cells scarcely four square metres in size.",
    des9: 'Nor is Charles VI — the so-called "mad king" — so far removed; the traits are disturbingly familiar.',
    des10:
      "As for today's activists and self-styled defenders of liberty and democracy, one finds more than a faint echo of Savonarola's moral absolutism. The difference lies only in their diminished eloquence and inability to rally the masses.",
    des11:
      "The so-called Arab Spring allowed many to purge their long-repressed frustrations, and transformed some into vocal opponents of authoritarianism. But their slogans, however legitimate in content, were devoid of cultural introspection.",
    des12:
      'We cannot democratise governance without first anchoring the rights of the individual — the right to express oneself freely and to live authentically, unburdened by traditional formulas such as "customs", "tradition", or "the forbidden".',
    des13:
      "This is why so many activists and opposition figures, for over a decade now, continue to recite the same mantras about democracy and human rights, without ever working to chart a path towards them.",
    des14:
      "Subconsciously, they parrot these phrases not out of principle, but to mask their intellectual impotence — their inability to conceive of genuine frameworks for change.",
    des15:
      "It is this confusion — this lack of conceptual clarity — that leads to what I call the Parrot Syndrome.",
    des16:
      "In functioning democracies, activist movements are often capable of generating public debate, pressuring political actors to engage with emerging demands. Whether related to the environment, animal welfare, or individual freedoms, such movements are often the very expression of ongoing cultural and social transformation.",
    des17:
      "But such shifts cannot occur without first emancipating the imagination — liberating the individual from inherited taboos and disabling fixations that suffocate human potential.",
    des18:
      "We must also distinguish between the role of the activist and that of the politician or political dissident.",
    des19:
      "The activist's role is to spotlight barriers to transformation, to awaken collective consciousness, and to galvanise groups into action — so that change becomes a political necessity embraced by parties or institutions.",
    des20:
      "Sadly, this distinction is rarely observed in our region. Both activists and dissidents tend to repeat the same empty slogans, mechanically and uncritically — parroting them with no real strategy for change.",
    des21:
      "Worse still, some Western governments encourage this sterile performance, failing to distinguish between those with genuine capability and those who merely imitate.",
    des22:
      "Yet we are not bound by this dilemma, nor by these two dismal archetypes.",
    des23:
      "We possess many pathways — and many tools — for real, substantive change: the kind that leads to the democratisation of meaning, of culture, and of society at large.",
    des24: "But this can only be achieved by conscious individuals.",
    des25:

      "An opinion article analyzing Turkey's military intervention in Syria following the U.S. troop withdrawal, highlighting geopolitical, humanitarian, and institutional implications.",
    des0: "The decision to withdraw US forces from northeastern Syria was both hasty and profoundly misguided—a strategic blunder that effectively eliminated any prospect of peace in an already fragmented country.",
    des1: "President Trump's reckless move handed the region over to the Turks, who wasted no time launching their offensive, killing and displacing innocent civilians in the process. We are now witnessing the early stages of a deliberate plan to alter the demographic fabric of the region.",
    des2: "It is nothing short of disgraceful that some Syrians have chosen to side with Turkish aggression—some even celebrating this military operation that endangers the lives of Syrians of all backgrounds: Kurds, Assyrians, Arabs, and Yazidis alike. Worse still, this incursion may pave the way for a resurgence of ISIS. It is pure fantasy to imagine, even for a moment, that the Turkish government is capable of managing or containing 118,000 detainees—fighters and their families—even if one were naïve enough to believe in Ankara's goodwill.",
    des3: "In reality, these human time bombs are set to become bargaining chips in Turkey's hands—deployed at will as leverage against any state that dares oppose its policies. Beyond that, Turkey will likely unleash these jihadists to complete its dirty work: assassinating members of the Autonomous Administration and sowing further instability across the region.",
    des4: "President Erdoğan still clings to the delusion of becoming a leader of the Islamist world—a modern-day caliph. We see this clearly in his determination to establish extremist institutions across northern Syria, particularly in areas under Turkish military occupation and the control of its Syrian proxies.",
    des5: 'Against this grim backdrop, the United Nations chases the mirage of a "constitutional committee", while doing nothing to condemn Turkey\'s blatant aggression on Syrian soil. But one should hardly be surprised by such inaction from a tired, antiquated institution that repeatedly demonstrates its inability to respond meaningfully to global crises. The UN has become little more than a revolving door for incompetent politicians and diplomats whom their governments are eager to discard.',
    des6: "Since the appointment of Geir Pedersen—whom I had thought could not possibly fare worse than his predecessor, Staffan de Mistura—it has become painfully clear that we have yet to hit rock bottom. Rather than act with urgency or vision, the new envoy confined himself for nearly a year to engaging with opposition figures, most of whom are beholden to belligerent Turkey. This alone reveals both his naivety and his failure to craft fresh approaches to an increasingly complex conflict.",
    des7: "What hope is there when a UN envoy seeks to build trust between a deranged regime and a fragmented opposition bankrolled by agents of destruction?",
    des8: "And what can one reasonably expect from António Guterres—the current UN Secretary-General—who previously failed spectacularly in resolving the Cyprus conflict during his tenure as special envoy?",
    des9: 'In a final, bitter irony, the long-delayed constitutional committee—after one year and seven months of repeated stillbirths—was finally brought into being, malformed and impotent, just days before Turkey launched its assault. And one of the guarantors of this very committee is a state actively working to carve up and annex Syrian territory under the cynical banner of "Operation Peace Spring"—more truthfully named the Fountain of Death and Destruction.',

      "A critical examination of the impact of the Arab Spring on women's rights in the MENA region, especially Syria, and the role of secularism in the quest for gender equality.",
    des0: "The recent wave of protests across several Arab countries raised significant hopes among women. These mass movements were, at the time, seen as the dawn of a new awareness, with the ultimate aim of achieving change. This period was preceded by a surge in secular and anti-religious movements, particularly in the virtual sphere, expressing a clear desire for substantial reforms. The goal of these secularists was to establish a democracy rooted in individual rights, allowing people at last to speak freely. Women were deeply involved in these secular movements, both prior to and during the emergence of the Arab Spring. Naturally, they hoped to lay the groundwork for gender equality and to bring an end to all forms of discrimination.",
    des1: 'Contrary to these aspirations, the Arab Spring gave rise to radical Islamism, grounded in a literal interpretation of certain violent verses from the Qur\'an—verses that reflect a deep-seated contempt for women, manifesting in misogynistic attitudes and discriminatory jurisprudence. While this "Spring" succeeded in toppling a few Arab dictators, it has, in many cases, replaced authoritarianism with a new form of tyranny: religious despotism. With the return of theocratic governance, women were among the first to suffer. Indeed, their situation has worsened in several Arab Spring countries, despite their active role in opposing authoritarian regimes and challenging social taboos.',
    des2: "Paradoxically, women's rights have regressed following the uprisings in the MENA region (Middle East and North Africa). In many of these countries, women have become primary targets of violence—be it physical, social, or economic. Nonetheless, the outcomes vary widely depending on the circumstances and diversity of each nation.",
    des3: "Take Syria, for instance: women's status varies significantly depending on their social, religious, or ethnic background. Syrian society is highly heterogeneous, and Common Law differs from one community to another. Four distinct personal status codes exist, pertaining to Catholic, Orthodox, Druze, and Sunni communities. For Sunnis, the code is based on Islamic Sharia. Although the Syrian Constitution proclaims secularity and freedom of worship, it also stipulates in Article 3 that the President of the Republic must be Muslim. Moreover, while the Constitution affirms gender equality in the workplace—promoting women's financial independence—it still contains discriminatory provisions, including penal codes that legally justify so-called \"honour crimes\".",
    des4: "Since the uprising of 2011, many women have fallen victim to rape—by both regime forces and rebel factions. The situation has further deteriorated, particularly in areas under Islamist rebel control. In territories held by the Islamic State, women accused of adultery have been stoned to death, and many are now confined to their homes by fear and force.",
    des5: "It is important to emphasise that other Islamist rebel groups also promote a rigid and restrictive interpretation of Islam, pushing to impose backward ideologies that obstruct women's liberation.",
    des6: "There is, however, a glimmer of hope in Syria. This can be seen in the Kurdish-held regions, where a secular and egalitarian model has been implemented. The self-administered Kurdish authorities have adopted a system that rejects all forms of discrimination against women, establishing legal and social equality between the sexes. In these areas, Kurdish women hold around forty percent of local council seats, and female fighters play a prominent role on the front lines against a barbaric enemy.",
    des7: "In conclusion, it is clear that in societies shaped by religion and entrenched taboos, women are deprived of meaningful emancipation. The prevailing culture in many Arab-Muslim societies is one that enslaves the individual, with women as its primary victims.",
    des8: "The Islamisation of these societies, and the rise to power of Islamist forces in certain states, have rendered women the principal losers. They face patriarchal injustices drawn from Qur'anic verses that give men superiority in legal rights and inheritance.",
    des9: "In the twenty-first century, the condition of Arab-Muslim women has deteriorated to the point where they are reduced to a reproductive function. This generates profound frustration, particularly as these same women, through access to information and social networks, are exposed to more emancipated models. The sense of revolt that this stirs is understandable.",
    des10:
      "Syrian women, however, have a unique opportunity. They can align themselves with the minorities—making up thirty-five percent of the population—who favour secularism. This remains the only path toward enshrining a Common Law based on the principles of equality and parity between women and men.",
    des11:
      "In the face of the Islamic State's barbarism, Muslim women have nothing to lose. They must adopt a critical mindset. They must question their belief system. They must scrutinise their adherence to a rigid, literalist interpretation of Islam. In this struggle, it is time for them—alongside enlightened men—to embark on the path towards secularism.",

      "A critical examination of the impact of the Arab Spring on women's rights in the MENA region, especially Syria, and the role of secularism in the quest for gender equality.",
    des0: "The recent wave of protests across several Arab countries raised significant hopes among women. These mass movements were, at the time, seen as the dawn of a new awareness, with the ultimate aim of achieving change. This period was preceded by a surge in secular and anti-religious movements, particularly in the virtual sphere, expressing a clear desire for substantial reforms. The goal of these secularists was to establish a democracy rooted in individual rights, allowing people at last to speak freely. Women were deeply involved in these secular movements, both prior to and during the emergence of the Arab Spring. Naturally, they hoped to lay the groundwork for gender equality and to bring an end to all forms of discrimination.",
    des1: 'Contrary to these aspirations, the Arab Spring gave rise to radical Islamism, grounded in a literal interpretation of certain violent verses from the Qur\'an—verses that reflect a deep-seated contempt for women, manifesting in misogynistic attitudes and discriminatory jurisprudence. While this "Spring" succeeded in toppling a few Arab dictators, it has, in many cases, replaced authoritarianism with a new form of tyranny: religious despotism. With the return of theocratic governance, women were among the first to suffer. Indeed, their situation has worsened in several Arab Spring countries, despite their active role in opposing authoritarian regimes and challenging social taboos.',
    des2: "Paradoxically, women's rights have regressed following the uprisings in the MENA region (Middle East and North Africa). In many of these countries, women have become primary targets of violence—be it physical, social, or economic. Nonetheless, the outcomes vary widely depending on the circumstances and diversity of each nation.",
    des3: "Take Syria, for instance: women's status varies significantly depending on their social, religious, or ethnic background. Syrian society is highly heterogeneous, and Common Law differs from one community to another. Four distinct personal status codes exist, pertaining to Catholic, Orthodox, Druze, and Sunni communities. For Sunnis, the code is based on Islamic Sharia. Although the Syrian Constitution proclaims secularity and freedom of worship, it also stipulates in Article 3 that the President of the Republic must be Muslim. Moreover, while the Constitution affirms gender equality in the workplace—promoting women's financial independence—it still contains discriminatory provisions, including penal codes that legally justify so-called \"honour crimes\".",
    des4: "Since the uprising of 2011, many women have fallen victim to rape—by both regime forces and rebel factions. The situation has further deteriorated, particularly in areas under Islamist rebel control. In territories held by the Islamic State, women accused of adultery have been stoned to death, and many are now confined to their homes by fear and force.",
    des5: "It is important to emphasise that other Islamist rebel groups also promote a rigid and restrictive interpretation of Islam, pushing to impose backward ideologies that obstruct women's liberation.",
    des6: "There is, however, a glimmer of hope in Syria. This can be seen in the Kurdish-held regions, where a secular and egalitarian model has been implemented. The self-administered Kurdish authorities have adopted a system that rejects all forms of discrimination against women, establishing legal and social equality between the sexes. In these areas, Kurdish women hold around forty percent of local council seats, and female fighters play a prominent role on the front lines against a barbaric enemy.",
    des7: "In conclusion, it is clear that in societies shaped by religion and entrenched taboos, women are deprived of meaningful emancipation. The prevailing culture in many Arab-Muslim societies is one that enslaves the individual, with women as its primary victims.",
    des8: "The Islamisation of these societies, and the rise to power of Islamist forces in certain states, have rendered women the principal losers. They face patriarchal injustices drawn from Qur'anic verses that give men superiority in legal rights and inheritance.",
    des9: "In the twenty-first century, the condition of Arab-Muslim women has deteriorated to the point where they are reduced to a reproductive function. This generates profound frustration, particularly as these same women, through access to information and social networks, are exposed to more emancipated models. The sense of revolt that this stirs is understandable.",
    des10:
      "Syrian women, however, have a unique opportunity. They can align themselves with the minorities—making up thirty-five percent of the population—who favour secularism. This remains the only path toward enshrining a Common Law based on the principles of equality and parity between women and men.",
    des11:
      "In the face of the Islamic State's barbarism, Muslim women have nothing to lose. They must adopt a critical mindset. They must question their belief system. They must scrutinise their adherence to a rigid, literalist interpretation of Islam. In this struggle, it is time for them—alongside enlightened men—to embark on the path towards secularism.",

      "An exploration of the Arab Spring, its complex origins, and the impact of repression and extremism on the region's political dynamics.",
    des0: "What came to be known as the 'Arab Spring' – as many prefer to call it – was the result of a complex accumulation of factors over decades. This reinforces the belief that it was not a spontaneous eruption but rather the outcome of psychological and social tensions, intensified by external stimuli that compelled millions to release their repressed internal frustrations. This release began gradually, eventually evolving into revolutions that toppled entrenched regimes plagued by corruption and authoritarianism.",
    des1: "Excessive repression by authoritarian regimes played a decisive role in activating the collective unconscious, which instinctively sought outlets to release the growing pressure, especially under the constraints on freedom of expression. In a bid to maintain power, some regimes in Arab-Islamic societies employed a calculated strategy by instrumentalising fundamentalist religion. They played a double game—on one hand, feigning secularism by attacking religious-based political parties, while on the other, fuelling extremism and undermining individual awareness.",
    des2: "The religious foundation of Arab societies, which often restricts individuals within a value system at odds with human psychological needs, made it easier for these regimes to dominate. Religion, rather than acting as a source of transcendence, became a refuge for those escaping their own realities and a world that denied their essential needs. This fusion of religion and authoritarian rule eroded national identity, particularly given that religion is inherently transnational, and religiosity does not necessarily uphold patriotism.",
    des3: "These regimes also co-opted nationalistic discourse, donning patriotism as a mask in a masquerade of despotism. The repetitive use of nationalist slogans led—especially among younger generations—to an unconscious aversion, stripping the language of its genuine substance.",
    des4: "In this vacuum, hard-line Islam—detached from the collective historical memory—began permeating the social fabric of certain communities. Islamist movements exploited a deep-rooted sense of defeat, offering a religious identity to individuals confined within cultural and ethical-religious structures resistant to change. Through this identity, they found a semblance of security and a psychological substitute for unmet desires.",

      "A critical examination of the impact of the Arab Spring on women’s rights in the MENA region, especially Syria, and the role of secularism in the quest for gender equality.",
    des1: "The recent wave of protests across several Arab countries raised significant hopes among women. These mass movements were, at the time, seen as the dawn of a new awareness, with the ultimate aim of achieving change. This period was preceded by a surge in secular and anti-religious movements, particularly in the virtual sphere, expressing a clear desire for substantial reforms. The goal of these secularists was to establish a democracy rooted in individual rights, allowing people at last to speak freely. Women were deeply involved in these secular movements, both prior to and during the emergence of the Arab Spring. Naturally, they hoped to lay the groundwork for gender equality and to bring an end to all forms of discrimination.",
    des2: "Contrary to these aspirations, the Arab Spring gave rise to radical Islamism, grounded in a literal interpretation of certain violent verses from the Qur’an—verses that reflect a deep-seated contempt for women, manifesting in misogynistic attitudes and discriminatory jurisprudence. While this “Spring” succeeded in toppling a few Arab dictators, it has, in many cases, replaced authoritarianism with a new form of tyranny: religious despotism. With the return of theocratic governance, women were among the first to suffer. Indeed, their situation has worsened in several Arab Spring countries, despite their active role in opposing authoritarian regimes and challenging social taboos.",
    des3: "Paradoxically, women’s rights have regressed following the uprisings in the MENA region (Middle East and North Africa). In many of these countries, women have become primary targets of violence—be it physical, social, or economic. Nonetheless, the outcomes vary widely depending on the circumstances and diversity of each nation.",
    des4: "Take Syria, for instance: women’s status varies significantly depending on their social, religious, or ethnic background. Syrian society is highly heterogeneous, and Common Law differs from one community to another. Four distinct personal status codes exist, pertaining to Catholic, Orthodox, Druze, and Sunni communities. For Sunnis, the code is based on Islamic Sharia. Although the Syrian Constitution proclaims secularity and freedom of worship, it also stipulates in Article 3 that the President of the Republic must be Muslim. Moreover, while the Constitution affirms gender equality in the workplace—promoting women’s financial independence—it still contains discriminatory provisions, including penal codes that legally justify so-called “honour crimes”.",
    des5: "Since the uprising of 2011, many women have fallen victim to rape—by both regime forces and rebel factions. The situation has further deteriorated, particularly in areas under Islamist rebel control. In territories held by the Islamic State, women accused of adultery have been stoned to death, and many are now confined to their homes by fear and force.",
    des6: "It is important to emphasise that other Islamist rebel groups also promote a rigid and restrictive interpretation of Islam, pushing to impose backward ideologies that obstruct women’s liberation.",
    des7: "There is, however, a glimmer of hope in Syria. This can be seen in the Kurdish-held regions, where a secular and egalitarian model has been implemented. The self-administered Kurdish authorities have adopted a system that rejects all forms of discrimination against women, establishing legal and social equality between the sexes. In these areas, Kurdish women hold around forty percent of local council seats, and female fighters play a prominent role on the front lines against a barbaric enemy.",
    des8: "In conclusion, it is clear that in societies shaped by religion and entrenched taboos, women are deprived of meaningful emancipation. The prevailing culture in many Arab-Muslim societies is one that enslaves the individual, with women as its primary victims.",
    des9: "The Islamisation of these societies, and the rise to power of Islamist forces in certain states, have rendered women the principal losers. They face patriarchal injustices drawn from Qur’anic verses that give men superiority in legal rights and inheritance.",
    des10:
      "In the twenty-first century, the condition of Arab-Muslim women has deteriorated to the point where they are reduced to a reproductive function. This generates profound frustration, particularly as these same women, through access to information and social networks, are exposed to more emancipated models. The sense of revolt that this stirs is understandable.",
    des11:
      "Syrian women, however, have a unique opportunity. They can align themselves with the minorities—making up thirty-five percent of the population—who favour secularism. This remains the only path toward enshrining a Common Law based on the principles of equality and parity between women and men.",
    des12:
      "In the face of the Islamic State’s barbarism, Muslim women have nothing to lose. They must adopt a critical mindset. They must question their belief system. They must scrutinise their adherence to a rigid, literalist interpretation of Islam. In this struggle, it is time for them—alongside enlightened men—to embark on the path towards secularism.",

      "An analysis of Turkey's stance during the fight against ISIS and its role as an ally in NATO.",
    des1: "To combat the Islamic State (IS)—that totalitarian monstrosity intent on subjugating the Middle East and, ultimately, the world—ten regional powers signed the 'Jeddah Communiqué,' pledging to support President Barack Obama’s campaign against IS. But one key signature was missing: that of Turkey under President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.",
    des2: "When US Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel attempted to persuade Turkey to join the international coalition, Ankara flatly refused. In doing so, it disrupted the core of Atlantic solidarity. Not only did Turkey decline to participate militarily, but it also prohibited American and NATO aircraft—those best placed to reach Iraq—from taking off from its airbases.",
    des3: "Let us recall: the Turkish air force is equipped with cutting-edge American military technology, its pilots are trained by the United States, and Turkey hosts 24 NATO bases. Until 20 September, Erdoğan’s official justification was the fate of 46 Turkish hostages captured by IS in Mosul in July. We now know they were released in exchange for Turkish assistance to jihadist forces fighting Kurds in Syria.",
    des4: "This hostage narrative concealed a far more troubling reality—one utterly incompatible with the values of an 'ally' that claims to oppose terrorism, seeks EU membership, and remains a pillar of NATO. Erdoğan’s Turkey has actively supported Islamist terrorist groups in both Syria and Iraq, including IS, which counts over 1,000 Turkish nationals among its ranks.",
    des5: "Since the outbreak of the Syrian civil war, Ankara has turned a blind eye to IS training camps on Syrian soil and has facilitated the flow of weapons and jihadists through its territory. These fighters, hailing from across the globe, pass freely through Turkey en route to the battlefields of Syria and Iraq. Many are recruited openly, in mosques, schools, and even among Turkey’s security services.",
    des6: "The Turkish government’s support for IS has been openly denounced by the opposition (notably the Republican People’s Party, CHP), which laments that their nation has become a sanctuary for jihadists. One such group, the powerful Naqshbandi Islamist Brotherhood, maintains close ties with Erdoğan’s ruling AKP.",
    des7: "Does the neo-Sultan in Ankara loathe the Alawite Bashar al-Assad more than he fears IS? Or is he aligning himself with jihadists—who, like him, are nostalgic for the Caliphate—against the secular Alawite Syrians, just as he politically opposes their Alevi cousins in Turkey, whom he equally deems 'infidels'?",
    des8: "In recent weeks, Turkey has behaved more like an ally of IS than a NATO partner. It stood by as Kurdish forces in Syria—under-equipped and under-supported—faced IS onslaughts, notably in Kobane. Turkish tanks and heavy weaponry reportedly fell into the hands of IS fighters. Moreover, Turkey has refused to curb the smuggling of hydrocarbons from fields and refineries controlled by IS in Iraq and Syria, a trade that generates an estimated $2 million daily for the group.",
    des9: "Erdogan’s ambiguous and complicit role can no longer be denied.",
    des10:
      "The United States and NATO, ever quick to condemn Russia over Iran or Ukraine, must show equal resolve in confronting a supposed ally that flouts every norm of Western solidarity. As a prominent NATO member, Turkey cannot plead neutrality.",
    des11:
      "Faced with a threat as grave as IS—arguably the most dangerous enemy of democracy since the Third Reich and the USSR—Erdoğan and his Prime Minister, Ahmet Davutoğlu, architects of the 'neo-Ottoman' vision, must take a clear stand: either Turkey remains within the Alliance and commits fully to the coalition against IS, ceasing all material support to jihadists, or it must face the consequences of acting as an accomplice to Islamist barbarity.",
    des12:
      "Likewise, NATO must finally adopt a consistent stance. Since 1974, the Alliance has tolerated Turkey’s occupation of 37% of Cyprus—an EU member state—as well as its continuous violations of Greek airspace, especially over the Aegean. It can no longer turn a blind eye to Ankara’s overt support for jihadist forces, a fact even the staunchest Kemalists condemn.",
    des13:
      "France, which rejoined NATO’s Integrated Command in 2009 after its withdrawal in 1966 under General de Gaulle, must take a stand. If Turkey refuses to clarify its position, should we continue to tolerate Erdoğan’s duplicitous machinations?",

      "An exploration of the Arab Spring, its complex origins, and the impact of repression and extremism on the region's political dynamics.",
    des1: "What came to be known as the 'Arab Spring' – as many prefer to call it – was the result of a complex accumulation of factors over decades. This reinforces the belief that it was not a spontaneous eruption but rather the outcome of psychological and social tensions, intensified by external stimuli that compelled millions to release their repressed internal frustrations. This release began gradually, eventually evolving into revolutions that toppled entrenched regimes plagued by corruption and authoritarianism.",
    des2: "Excessive repression by authoritarian regimes played a decisive role in activating the collective unconscious, which instinctively sought outlets to release the growing pressure, especially under the constraints on freedom of expression. In a bid to maintain power, some regimes in Arab-Islamic societies employed a calculated strategy by instrumentalising fundamentalist religion. They played a double game—on one hand, feigning secularism by attacking religious-based political parties, while on the other, fuelling extremism and undermining individual awareness.",
    des3: "The religious foundation of Arab societies, which often restricts individuals within a value system at odds with human psychological needs, made it easier for these regimes to dominate. Religion, rather than acting as a source of transcendence, became a refuge for those escaping their own realities and a world that denied their essential needs. This fusion of religion and authoritarian rule eroded national identity, particularly given that religion is inherently transnational, and religiosity does not necessarily uphold patriotism.",
    des4: "These regimes also co-opted nationalistic discourse, donning patriotism as a mask in a masquerade of despotism. The repetitive use of nationalist slogans led—especially among younger generations—to an unconscious aversion, stripping the language of its genuine substance.",
    des5: "In this vacuum, hard-line Islam—detached from the collective historical memory—began permeating the social fabric of certain communities. Islamist movements exploited a deep-rooted sense of defeat, offering a religious identity to individuals confined within cultural and ethical-religious structures resistant to change. Through this identity, they found a semblance of security and a psychological substitute for unmet desires.",
    des6: "Modern communication technologies, of course, played a major role in facilitating the exchange of information, creating fertile ground for rebellion against tyranny. However, information is the foundation of knowledge—not knowledge itself. It contributes to the formation of mental representations, both consciously and subconsciously, through sensory inputs. Once external conditions permit, the subconscious pushes these representations to the surface.",
    des7: "If we examine the subconscious preparatory stages leading to the uprisings, we find a latent rejection of harsh realities and a constant search for release. The subconscious seeks ways to alleviate pressure, and when suitable conditions arise, this subconscious state transitions into conscious awareness. Given that many individuals in these societies share similar suffering, this awareness often evolves into a collective demand for radical change.",
    des8: "It must be emphasised that repression—be it political, social, or religious—is a core driver in prompting the mind to seek expression. Other factors, such as economic decline, also played a role by sealing off the final outlets for release, creating a societal pressure cooker. This was particularly true after Western countries closed off migration routes.",
    des9: "In such conditions, Islamist movements—better organised than their secular or liberal counterparts—quickly filled the political and cultural vacuum left behind. Although they gained momentum, their ability to sustain long-term governance remained questionable, as their structure mirrored that of the repressive regimes they opposed, particularly in their approach to censorship and control. More importantly, these movements remained trapped in a past era, disconnected from contemporary realities. Egypt is perhaps the clearest example of political Islam’s dwindling support base.",
    des10:
      "Among all Arab uprisings, the Syrian case emerged as the most complex, for a multitude of intertwined reasons. What began as calls for reform quickly met with violent repression, causing the demands to escalate into calls for regime change and the removal of President Bashar al-Assad.",
    des11:
      "At that time, Western powers—chiefly France, Britain, and the United States—appeared to adopt firm rhetoric, making statements such as 'Assad must step down' and declaring the regime illegitimate. Ambassadors were recalled, and diplomatic ties severed, leading many to believe that military intervention was imminent. Yet, nothing of the sort materialised.",
    des12:
      "Despite the heavy toll of the Syrian uprising, it failed to garner the trust of the country’s minorities. This stemmed from deep-seated mistrust among Syria’s social groups, disillusionment with the prospects of democratic transformation, and an absence of concrete guarantees for the protection of minority interests.",
    des13:
      "The Syrian opposition—whether the National Council or the later National Coalition—proved unable to offer meaningful reassurances. It failed to understand the legitimate fears of minorities, who were concerned about being marginalised in any post-regime future. Most opposition leaders lacked a true culture of diversity, viewing minorities through the lens of tolerance rather than equal partnership. While they repeated phrases such as 'respecting all communities,' their rhetoric lacked substance.",
    des14:
      "This shortcoming coincided with the rise of political Islam and the infiltration of jihadist groups, many of which targeted specific sects. This confirmed the regime’s narrative, which from the outset warned of extremist threats to minorities, using such claims to justify its brutal crackdown.",
    des15:
      "The regime capitalised on this chaos, presenting itself as the defender of minorities and benefiting from its long experience in exploiting the opposition’s errors. The spread of jihadist movements, in particular, gave the regime a pretext to consolidate its control.",
    des16:
      "Meanwhile, opposition groups focused on securing legitimacy from foreign sponsors, neglecting the crucial task of engaging Syria’s minorities—who constitute between 35% and 40% of the population. The mere inclusion of a few minority figures in opposition structures failed to create a genuine sense of representation.",
    des17:
      "Thus, the minority issue became a central part of the solution—but its neglect deepened the crisis and transformed the conflict into a protracted bloodbath.",
    des18:
      "Beyond the issue of minorities, many opposition figures remained incapable of formulating a realistic discourse aligned with national and international interests. Their language was emotional, reliant on slogans, lacking the experiential grounding required to grasp the ethical and political complexities of the Syrian conflict.",
    des19:
      "From a psychological and anthropological perspective, morality emerges from individual interactions with the environment. Moral systems evolve based on psychological needs and collective interests. As Schopenhauer suggested, morality often stems from individual egoism filtered through social adaptation.",
    des20:
      "Societies built on perpetual tension generate individuals unable to adapt to changing conditions. This explains why some opposition factions reduced the conflict to simplistic binaries—good versus evil, right versus wrong. They lacked strategic vision and remained confined by emotional responses, bound to shallow assumptions incompatible with Syria’s multifaceted reality.",
    des21:
      "Two crucial questions posed by Russia remain unanswered by the United States: – Who is the viable alternative to the current regime—capable of governing, safeguarding international interests, and maintaining control in Syria? – If Assad agrees to step down, where would he and his leadership go? And what happens to their assets? No country will finance their exile.",
    des22:
      "To date, no American team with adequate experience has emerged to manage the complexities of the Syrian file. U.S. policymakers appear to have internalised the opposition’s slogans, echoing them in a superficial attempt to promote certain figures and structures.",
    des23:
      "This lack of coherence is not unique to Washington. France and Britain have similarly faltered. Despite pushing for the lifting of the arms embargo on opposition groups, they hesitated to implement it, due to disagreements over potential consequences.",
    des24:
      "Many Western actors remain opposed to arming the opposition for several reasons: • The absence of a clear mechanism to distribute weapons safely, amid concerns that arms might fall into jihadist hands—with over 800 European jihadists reportedly active in Syria. • Fears that such actions would be seen as a strategic challenge to Russia, prompting it to escalate arms transfers to the regime and intensify the conflict. • The lack of a credible political alternative, reinforcing Russia’s insistence on a political settlement that maintains its influence in the region.",
    des25:
      "Russia views negotiation as an integral part of warfare. A comprehensive settlement requires the inclusion of all major stakeholders. American insistence on presenting the fragmented 'Coalition' as the sole representative at the Geneva II conference clashed with Moscow’s position.",
    des26:
      "A lasting solution cannot be reached without engaging moderate voices capable of articulating pragmatic demands and safeguarding the interests of all segments of society. Syria’s pluralism must be acknowledged and reflected in any viable settlement. The illusion of majority rule, if misapplied, risks dismantling the very unity it seeks to preserve.",
    des27:
      "While international consensus is essential, internal reconciliation is even more pressing. Ending the bloodshed demands the inclusion of all political forces and social groups in Syria. A serious dialogue must begin—one that addresses the root causes of the crisis, not just its symptoms.",
    des28:
      "Syria’s tragedy is not simply a power struggle; it is a crisis of identity, statehood, and social cohesion. Ignoring these elements has driven the country deeper into conflict. Experience has shown that exclusion, regardless of its source, only breeds extremism.",

      "An analysis of Syria’s ethnic and religious minorities in the context of the ongoing conflict and the role these groups play in Syria’s future political landscape.",
    des1: "In light of the fierce battle waged by the regime against its own people, it has become increasingly evident that the opposition’s leadership is struggling to respond effectively. There are several reasons for this: foremost among them is the absence of a diverse foundation of political parties within the Syrian body politic—save for the Kurdish parties, who, despite enduring harsh repression, have long been engaged in activism and moments of heightened mobilisation. Another key reason is the lack of pluralistic thought embedded within Syrian culture and society.",
    des2: "The Syrian regime has played a pivotal role in nurturing and activating a singular trend within the consciousness of individuals, by constructing a monolithic cultural model. This model has been built upon a framework of curated information and accumulated memories, which are then used to reinforce a specific culture—resulting in a unified vision and strategy. Such a model limits individuals’ capacities for understanding what might be considered creative or constructive processes. It fosters mental rigidity and an unwillingness to entertain alternative interpretations of reality.",
    des3: "Evidence of this can be found in the striking similarity between the discourse employed by the Syrian regime and that of the opposition. Despite their ideological differences and fierce rivalry, the dominant modes of rhetoric, analysis, and strategy appear remarkably alike. The regime relies heavily on stirring up fear among minorities—be they ethnic, religious, sectarian, or ideological—of the political Islam present among some of the regime’s opponents.",
    des4: "This fear becomes a vital card in the regime’s hand, enabling it to recast the conflict as a binary one: either with or against Assad. For instance, the regime often exploits Arab nationalist sentiments which, by their nature, position all ethnic minorities as subordinate. We witnessed a similar bias during the recent Cairo conference of the Syrian opposition, where some displayed a rigid stance regarding the recognition of the Kurdish people’s rights, despite the fact that Kurds are indigenous and deeply rooted in this region.",
    des5: "Many Syrians continue to view the Kurdish issue through the lens of conspiracy. In anticipation of potential recognition of their rights, they accuse the Kurds of plotting secession and seeking to establish an independent Kurdish entity in the region. It is imperative to recall the long history of Kurdish resistance against the Syrian regime’s oppression. Since the days of Hafez al-Assad, Kurds have played a significant role in Syria’s broader struggle. Their persecution began as early as the 1950s, culminating in the racially motivated 1962 census—signed by President Nazim al-Qudsi—which stripped over 120,000 Kurdish citizens of their nationality, launching a systematic campaign of marginalisation.",
    des6: "History bears witness to the deep-rooted connection of the Kurdish people to the Syrian homeland. This will become more apparent during a transitional phase of independence, in which citizenship is upheld as a fundamental right. Yet, the rise of Arab nationalist sentiment marked the beginning of discrimination across Syrian society, particularly the denial of even the most basic rights to ethnic minorities. Addressing the Kurdish issue—acknowledging past wrongs and seeking to redress them—serves to advance the revolutionary cause and to lay the foundation for a nation built on equal citizenship.",
    des7: "For this reason, it is also essential to speak about other minorities, notably the Alawite sect, which constitutes an integral part of any solution. Winning the trust of the Alawi community could hasten the collapse of the Assad regime by opening channels of dialogue with individuals who might serve as influential intermediaries. The opposition must embrace inclusive national rhetoric, ensuring that Alawis are part of Syria’s future political landscape.",
    des8: "Alawis and other religious minorities are gripped by a deep fear of persecution. We must not overlook the Alawis’ history of suffering, preserved in our collective memory—replete with experiences of marginalisation and discrimination dating back to the time of Sultan Abdulhamid. Recollecting this history is crucial if we are to break free from the legacy of historical isolation and extreme poverty that gave rise to stark class divides.",
    des9: "What is sorely lacking in this climate of high tension is the inclusion of the silent segments of society, as well as those aligned with the regime, who, much like their counterparts in the opposition, are acting from a position of self-preservation. Bringing these groups into the fold could enrich the uprising and help it reflect Syria’s national diversity more faithfully.",
    des10:
      "In this regard, I believe that upholding the principle of credibility—especially in terms of news and information—will benefit us greatly. It could help reassure those frightened groups whose only current motivation is a yearning for stability, security, and calm.",
    des11:
      "We must also recognise that there are obscure elements within the revolutionary movement that are, whether knowingly or not, serving the interests of Assad and prolonging his grip on power. The violent acts carried out by certain factions within the opposition are often in pursuit of narrow self-interest. While these actions have rightly drawn criticism, they should not be allowed to undermine the broader importance of the revolutionary movement. Instead, we must work to expose such actors and isolate them, ensuring that the struggle does not descend into sectarian conflict—a scenario that would only serve the agendas of regional powers.",

      "Since its eruption, the Syrian uprising—confronting a totalitarian regime—has struggled to win over ethnic and religious minorities, as well as other groups wary of losing the individual freedoms they had under Assad should Islamists rise to power. Various factors have fuelled the fears and hesitation of these communities. Chief among them is a growing sense of hopelessness that any genuine social or cultural transformation will take place, particularly given the territorial and societal inroads made by religious rebels, who have managed to penetrate the very fabric of Syrian society. The censorship imposed on individuals has allowed radical religious currents to infiltrate daily life, becoming a last refuge for many. The psychological toll inflicted by the regime’s repressive mechanisms has stripped individuals of the capacity to envision self-sufficient ways of improving their conditions. Faced with these frustrations—present at every level of society—it is understandable that many seek refuge in religion as a means of coping with their daily realities, a way to compensate for their losses, even if this compensation is illusory or unrealistic. This pattern is often seen in societies subjected to totalitarian oppression.",
    des1: "Islamists in Syria are increasingly descending upon the popular movement, positioning themselves as the strongest and most widespread current among the Syrian factions, relying heavily on the religious and conservative foundations of certain communities.",
    des2: "Their prominence stems, firstly, from the belief among many Syrians involved in the uprising that the international community has abandoned them, leaving them vulnerable to the regime’s brutality. Secondly, it arises from the Islamists’ strategic exploitation of the Syrian psyche, allowing them to infiltrate the public sphere in a systematic and organised manner.",

This makes Islamists serious players on the Syrian stage, with considerable sway over the course of the uprising, often skewing it towards specific religious orientations.",

    des2: "The attempt to unmask the true face of these radical Islamist movements should not be misconstrued as an attack on Islam itself. On the contrary, it stems from a desire to liberate Islam from its tribal origins, so that it might adapt to the evolving dynamics of history and modernity.",
    des3: "Perhaps we must also turn our attention to the Arab-Islamic psyche, which harbours within it a certain form of awareness—sometimes even a recognition—that the world has moved beyond it. Although this psyche is dispersed across diverse societies, and although the collective memory of each varies due to different social structures, these societies share common afflictions and comparable symptoms.",
    des4: "This is largely due to the influence of two unifying factors: religion and language—beneath which the Arab world is broadly unified.",
    des5: "Before delving further, it is worth reflecting on the role of language in shaping collective consciousness and harmonising individual perception. Language wields a powerful influence in bringing people together; it carries with it layers of accumulated experience passed down through generations.",
    des6: "The models we internalise are often drawn from visual memory or oral transmission, frequently charged with emotional resonance. Since the invention of writing, human beings have recorded their thoughts—and in doing so, their behaviours—embedding them in the collective memory.",
    des7: "These records manifest as customs, which arise from a process of communal filtration of individual experiences. What aligns with the external environment is retained; what does not is discarded. Over time, these filtered experiences become the foundations of communal ethics and codes of conduct, imposed upon individuals.",
    des8: "What Islam has attempted to do—or more precisely, what it has done over centuries (as with other religions)—is to implant mental representations that offer psychological comfort in the face of a painful, deprived reality.",
    des9: "What sets Islam apart in our current era, however, is its insistence on excluding the other—a trait that contemporary iterations of other religions have largely abandoned. These religions were previously excluded from political structures, and were thus compelled to adopt a more spiritual character, one that better aligns with individual psychological needs.",
    des10:
      "The goal, then, is to return religions—and the gods they invoke—to their original source: the human psyche.",
    des11:
      "This calls for a critical reassessment of the history curriculum in Arab schools with Islamic cultural orientations. While differences in emphasis exist between countries, these curricula are often deliberately structured to generate imagery of Islamic victories and to instil a sense of superiority over others.",
    des12:
      "This attitude is encapsulated in a phrase repeated by many Muslims: “Thank God for the blessing of Islam”—a statement laden with chauvinism and implicit exclusion of the other.",
    des13:
      "Undoubtedly, the Muslim individual’s experience of marginalisation and their repeated frustrations—stemming from an inability to contribute creatively or civilisationally, as others do—has led to a kind of internalised, limited awareness, one that is constantly nourished by sacred history and unquestioned texts.",
    des14:
      "Let me reiterate: the problem does not lie with Islam per se, but with the structure of all religions, which tend to deprive the individual of even their most basic physical needs. Religions enclose individuals within a shell through which clerics extend their control over communities.",
    des15:
      "It must also be noted that most religions and belief systems engage in a process of erasing what preceded them—even as they borrow and absorb the ideas of those prior systems. They claim for themselves the mantle of salvation, enlightenment, or truth.",
    des16:
      "This is made especially clear in Islam’s depiction of pre-Islamic Arabia as an age of ignorance (jahiliyyah), thereby dismissing all prior knowledge and heritage—even though Islam itself is a product of that very cultural and historical milieu.",
    des17:
      "Our pride in religious or cultural identity is often the result of a process of self-glorification. Individuals tend to affirm that which mirrors their own psychological and cultural structure, while rejecting what is unfamiliar or different. This is what we mean by perception. Expanding one’s awareness requires openness to difference.",
    des18:
      "The rigidity with which individuals cling to their beliefs, cultures, or inherited knowledge is largely the product of conditioned indoctrination.",
    des19:
      "Returning to the subject of mental representations drawn from distorted histories—delivered to children through school curricula, reinforced in places of worship, or transmitted through the general culture of Islamised societies—recent neurological studies show that these representations become fixed in the long-term collective memory through repeated exposure.",
    des20:
      "With time, they evolve into absolute truths that cannot be questioned or re-examined. They become pillars of behaviour, shaping the very foundations of social conduct.",
    des21:
      "These embedded mental constructs profoundly influence perception and shape behaviour within tightly defined parameters. We find that Islamic culture, in particular, has sought to strip Islamised societies of their pre-existing histories, positioning itself as the sole origin of knowledge and science, thus denying the wider human contribution that preceded it.",
    des22:
      "In doing so, it seeks to impose a singular mode of thinking, making it easier to govern and control the masses.",

    des4: "With this in mind, I have chosen to clarify in this article the mechanism by which the brain has evolved over time, drawing on certain contemporary neurological theories.",
    des5: "Michael Persinger contends that changes in two fundamental brain structures — the hippocampus and the amygdala — contributed to our acquisition of two key traits: the capacity for memory and for evaluating events.",
    des6: "He argues that memory is grounded in emotional charges and sensations, driven by the principles of reward and punishment.",
    des7: "Persinger concluded that over time, stimuli affecting the hippocampus enabled the reactivation of past memories. These memories, in turn, were embellished by human imagination and fantasy.",
    des8: "The amygdala, meanwhile, evolved into a central hub for regulating emotions associated with experiences, allowing us to feel joy, delight, or intense depression.",
    des9: "From this, it becomes clear that memory — particularly long-term memory — forms the foundation for the development of human consciousness, enabling us to store accumulated experiences across time.",
    des10:
      "Gerald Edelman added another vital concept to our understanding of brain development: the notion of value, which is linked to personal history and the experiences it produces.",
    des11:
      "The brain’s evolutionary capacity to form mental representations and internal scenes, he argued, emerged from this store of experiences — preserved in long-term memory as both cognitive and emotional values.",
    des12:
      "Henri Laborit, for his part, explored the influence of social culture on memory, suggesting that it generates a kind of automaticity in the individual, which he called “cultural categorisation”.",
    des13:
      "According to Laborit, culture and the surrounding environment shape the course of memory by filtering information in accordance with the group’s cultural norms and its shifting needs.",
    des14:
      "In order to define individual need within a collective framework, he proposed that such need represents a quantity of energy or information required to sustain neural structures — whether innate or acquired through learning.",
    des15:
      "He described this mechanism as a stable transformation in neural connections: cells produce peptide chains that generate proteins, which in turn form new neural links in response to external stimuli.",
    des16:
      "In this context, “need” becomes a primary driver. Within a collective setting, however, these needs can only be fulfilled through the principle of “group dominance”, which transforms the balance between internal and external needs into a tool of control over others.",
    des17:
      "It is through this process, according to Laborit, that hierarchical structures between groups emerged.",
    des18:
      "The more deeply we delve into what occurs within the human brain from a scientific standpoint, the wider the gap becomes between us and the superstitious thinking that still prevails in many cultures.",
    des19:
      "This superstitious mindset forms a kind of inherited cognitive barrier that hinders the mind’s openness. We cannot transcend this barrier without a rigorous scientific pursuit of the unknown.",

      "Only through science and knowledge can we expand our awareness. If we were to journey through the brain guided by neuropsychology, we would discover countless mental representations — both conscious and unconscious.",

      "Yet only conscious representations have the power to break the automaticity of thought and to generate new laws and insights through awareness.",
    des22:
      "Focusing on Edelman’s theory, we see that he offered an explanation for the evolution of the human brain. In his book The Biology of Consciousness, he described a reciprocal relationship between genetic influences on behaviour and the impact of behaviour on genes.",
    des23:
      "He asserted that the environment plays a role in selecting certain behaviours through natural selection. Yet, he also argued that individual behaviour, in turn, shapes the process of natural selection within the environment.",
    des24:
      "Moreover, Edelman highlighted the importance of morphology — the study of form — in the development of consciousness, suggesting that this process arose from the gradual selection and evolution of the nervous system, a phenomenon referred to as morphological evolution.",

      "Let us pause briefly to consider the relationship between genes and natural selection, in order to understand how behaviours that are not genetically inherited can still be acquired.",

      "In the first part, I paused at the mechanism behind the evolution of consciousness. In this article, I turn to a more contemporary theory: the Theory of Neuronal Group Selection, proposed by Gerald Edelman, a biologist and director of the Neurosciences Institute in La Jolla, California.",
    des1: "Edelman divided consciousness into two levels: primary consciousness and higher-order consciousness—the latter being distinguished by its greater complexity and cognitive depth.",
    des2: "What is primary consciousness?",
    des3: "Edelman posited that primary consciousness arises from two systems within the nervous system.",
    des4: "The first consists of structures such as the brainstem and the limbic system. This network governs essential biological functions including feeding, sexual behaviour, and defensive strategies—functions shaped and inherited through evolution. It also oversees other basic processes like respiration, sweating, and sleep. In essence, it forms the foundation for survival and is present in all organisms equipped with a nervous system.",
    des5: "The second system is the thalamo-cortical complex, which includes the thalamus—the central hub of the brain composed of various nuclei responsible for relaying sensory signals to the cortex. This complex acts as a gatekeeper, filtering incoming information: amplifying some signals while attenuating others.",
    des6: "Over evolutionary time, these two systems became interconnected, giving rise to what Edelman calls primary consciousness—a capacity enabling living beings to adapt to their environments. Learning thus becomes the essential mechanism of adaptation in both humans and animals, as the environment is not fixed but constantly shifting across time and space. Nature, through selection, eliminates maladaptive structures and preserves those that adjust effectively. Behaviour, rooted in environmental experience, is shaped by this process of learning, driven fundamentally by the need to meet physiological demands and the impulses governed by the brainstem and limbic system.",
    des7: "According to Edelman, primary consciousness developed in parallel with evolution, and was enabled by three key mechanisms:",
    des8: "1. The cortical system, which allowed for the integration of cognitive concepts with emotional processes, thereby expanding the brain’s capacity to learn.",
    des9: "2. A novel form of conceptual memory, capable of organising and categorising inputs from various brain systems, thus enabling the classification of perceptual processes.",
    des10:
      "3. Reentrant loops—complex neural circuits that permit continuous, recursive exchange of information (feedback) across connected structures. These loops enable memory to process perceptual classification in real-time, facilitating adaptive responses.",
    des11:
      "Edelman, alongside Giulio Tononi, emphasised the importance of the thalamo-cortical loops in the emergence of consciousness. They argue that primary consciousness in both humans and animals stems from the interaction between short-term memory and perceptual classification—a dynamic interplay that gives rise to conscious experience.",
    des12:
      "While organisms with primary consciousness can form internal images, Edelman contended that they lack the ability to observe those images through the lens of a social self—a distinctly human capacity that emerged with the evolution of higher cognitive functions. Higher-order consciousness enables the brain to link each mental representation to others, forming interconnected chains of thought.",
    des13:
      "We thus distinguish between perceptual classification, which interprets sensory input from the external world, and conceptual classification, which occurs internally, relying on memory to shape abstract concepts.",
    des14:
      "Although this capacity is most developed in humans, studies suggest that chimpanzees also possess elements of self-awareness. The development of individuality is closely tied to social interaction, through which one constructs a model of the world by connecting past, present, and future—a process requiring symbolic memory. The evolution of vocal tracts and brain regions involved in language comprehension and production was instrumental in the development of spoken language, which in turn played a central role in the expansion of human consciousness and the emergence of the self.",
    des15:
      "These social interactions, and the resulting ability to store symbolic relationships over extended periods—through the convergence of multiple memory systems and the emergence of experience-based memory—enabled humans to link the past with the present and imagine the future. This played a pivotal role in the development of higher-order consciousness.",
    des16:
      "According to Edelman, the brain is subject to two selective processes: natural selection, and somatic selection, the latter being a refinement within the former. These mechanisms enable the brain to connect sensory signals with mental representations, leading to the formation of consciousness based on the interplay between perception, conceptual frameworks, and memory—all shaped by a value system that evolved over time.",
    des17:
      "In The Biology of Consciousness, Edelman explains how higher-order consciousness contributes to the emergence of imagination, emotion, sensation, thought, selfhood, and volition. Human behaviour, he argues, is driven by memory, which is itself shaped by reclassification processes that respond to biological shifts and evolving value systems.",
    des18:
      "When considering these modern theories, it becomes evident that our engagement with concepts—whether social or religious—is rooted in an ongoing process of transformation across time. There is no fixed perception, no immutable concept. Rather, the values we ascribe to the external world stem from a consciousness that is itself in flux, adjusting in response to life and nature.",
    des19:
      "Over millions of years, evolution has selected for learning mechanisms that enable living organisms to adapt to varying environments. Thus, morality—emerging from our perceptual evaluation of phenomena—is not static, but evolves as our perception shifts, either generating new values or abandoning those no longer suited to the changing external context.",

      "An analytical essay originally published in Al-Hiwar al-Mutamaddin on 14 April 2011, exploring the psychological and structural mechanisms of totalitarian regimes with a focus on Syria.",
    des1: "There is no doubt that cultural structures and historical heritage vary considerably across Arab countries. Yet, despite these differences, totalitarian regimes throughout the region repeat and reproduce the same mechanisms of repression to which they subject their populations. This is because the very architecture of these regimes—and the power apparatuses that sustain them—are shaped by analogous developmental processes and rest upon a similar psychological foundation. Totalitarian regimes are inherently incapable of comprehending anything that transcends their repressive tools and methods.",
    des2: "Likewise, although revolutions differ significantly in structure, intensity, causes, and consequences, it is possible to discern shared denominators and commonalities in the general conditions that give rise to them, as well as in their primary objectives.",
    des3: "Revolutions that have occurred in various parts of the world and in differing historical contexts have generally been the product of a conscious ferment, simmering beneath the surface as a result of a collective experience of hardship and suffering. If we examine the underlying mechanism of revolutions carefully, we find that such events are preceded by various stages of unconscious accumulation.",
    des4: "Individual subjects typically begin by observing their social grievances in silence, yet with a conscious awareness. They attempt to resolve these issues through civil society institutions, wherever such institutions exist and wherever a minimal degree of freedom is granted. However, when such channels are absent, or when intellectual diversity is stifled, the capacity to transform awareness into reform becomes severely constrained. In such contexts, individuals confront a political system governed by a totalitarian logic, dominated by a singular orientation that excludes all diversity of thought and sentiment.",
    des5: "Totalitarian regimes draw their strength (and, indeed, their fragility) from the systematic suppression of any individual effort to think independently or seek solutions to social problems without the intervention of the state. These regimes often respond to such initiatives with severe physical and psychological punishment.",
    des6: "In these systems, acts of independent agency aimed at improving society can be so thoroughly marginalised that they are often mistaken for mere expressions of general frustration or anger—outbursts triggered by the continuous repression of libidinal forces and human drives. Individuals trapped within the iron grip of a despotic regime suffer acute psychological afflictions. Their frustration may manifest in distorted behaviours and internal contradictions. On the one hand, they attempt to convince themselves that no escape is possible, that survival requires surrender. This surrender becomes a kind of deliberate apathy. They may even begin to adopt the slogans propagated by their repressive regimes, using them as a form of compensation for the absence of fulfilment or self-actualisation.",
    des7: "Through this apparatus of repression and deliberate marginalisation, despotic regimes seek to obliterate both individual identity and intellect. They pervert the human subject, turning them against their own desires and aspirations. In this context, one must acknowledge the role of religious institutions, which are tactically mobilised to cultivate religious extremism. Despotic regimes understand all too well that their survival depends on the intellectual and psychological suppression of their people.",
    des8: "If we examine the Syrian regime as an example of this phenomenon, we find a longstanding and deliberate effort to encourage fundamentalist religions within Syria. Its relative success in maintaining control over Syrian society hinges on this duplicitous strategy. On the surface, it presents itself as a secular government, restricting the freedoms of certain Islamic fundamentalist groups that openly challenge its authority. Yet, simultaneously, it plays an active role in spreading a culture of religious fundamentalism at a broader popular level. In doing so, the regime manufactures a justification for excluding and suppressing religious groups deemed to have an anti-government agenda.",
    des9: "This duplicity is also evident in the Syrian regime’s foreign policy. It has actively disseminated narratives and ideas that bear little resemblance to reality or to the concealed intentions behind its policies. The regime has succeeded in persuading both its own citizens and other nations in the region that it supports the oppressed and colonised peoples of the Middle East and that it represents the beating heart of Arab nationalism. Its propaganda rests on empty slogans, bolstered by a few media stories and official statements. In truth, however, this regime does not hesitate to offer concessions or compromises—whether to real or imagined adversaries—if doing so ensures its continued grip on power.",
    des10:
      "The regime has also tirelessly propagated the notion of conspiracy, exaggerating external threats from neighbouring countries to compensate its people for their repressed desires. A Syrian citizen is led to believe that they hold immense significance in the region, that their usurped ego is in fact collective, not individual. This collective ego is presented as perfectly aligned with the identity of the regime. The notion of conspiracy and foreign threat serves as a psychological sedative, accounting for the widespread submission and complacency among many Syrians.",
    des11:
      "Of course, the Syrian people are not the only population subjected to such manipulation. The same political tactic is deployed by other totalitarian regimes, and particularly by religious groups whose ideologies stand opposed to progress, transformation, and the very principle of life. The conspiracy theory becomes the only palliative available to a people who have nothing new to contribute to humanity and who are no longer capable of understanding anything beyond their narrow systems of belief and knowledge. Certainly, competing interests exist between nations and global powers seeking dominance—but totalitarian regimes habitually use such tensions as a pretext to suppress their own citizens in the name of foreign policy.",
    des12:
      "To understand the psychological mechanism by which oppressed individuals come to adopt the very slogans and vocabulary of their oppressors, one can turn to Robert Zajonc’s theory of the mere exposure effect. According to Zajonc, repeated exposure to a particular idea renders it more palatable. The brain, compelled by frequency, begins to favour this stimulus. In other words, the mere repetition of an idea enhances its acceptability and may even cause it to be internalised as truth—particularly when it corresponds with emotional impulses or psychological motivations such as fear of punishment or hope of reward. At that point, the individual mind loses its capacity to perceive reality with clarity and detachment.",
    des13:
      "The more deeply a totalitarian regime sinks into despotism, the more it imitates the structures and strategies of religious belief systems. This enables it to enslave every element of the society it rules. The Syrian regime serves as a prime example. The attempt to elevate the head of state into a quasi-sacred figure, to be venerated by citizens who live through and for the ‘leader’, is grounded in psychological manipulation. The goal is to dissolve the individual ego within the symbolic figure of the ruler, creating a shared emotional structure that is endlessly reinforced by media propaganda. Ironically, this mechanism may produce a perverse sense of identity—one that is occasionally rewarded with trifling privileges which pale in comparison to the regime’s own hoarded power and wealth.",
    des14:
      "Let us return to those preliminary, unconscious phases that precede revolutionary outbreaks. Having outlined some of the mechanisms of psychological repression faced by individuals, we can observe how such apparatuses reach a point of perversion in which repressed individuals voluntarily and consciously adopt the language and logic of their oppressors—thus becoming agents of repression themselves.",
    des15:
      "And yet, the unconscious mind does not accept this alienation. It rebels against the psychological crisis and seeks an outlet. This is the stage of unconscious fermentation: a violent internal struggle between the ego and the unconscious. When shared by many within a single cultural context, this struggle becomes a collective drive—a form of group therapy, a shared attempt to find a way out of an unbearable condition. In psychoanalytic terms, the unconscious perpetually seeks to mitigate suffering and process the negative drives repressed by social structures. Under such strain, even a minor external trigger can provoke an eruption. Suppressed impulses spill forth, first gradually and then in the form of conscious collective action aimed at radical transformation.",
    des16:
      "Revolutions are, at their inception, an unconscious effort. The psychological desires and shared drives of individuals accumulate over time, eventually converging into a conscious force for change—often without the backing of any prior political or social structures equipped to absorb the shock of transformation.",
    des17:
      "At this critical juncture, the role of intellectuals and experts becomes vital. They must help to structure and guide this raw, apolitical, and socially unanchored desire for change. A theoretical framework must be developed to support revolutionary movements, helping them navigate the disorder of revolutionary periods and their aftermath. This intervention is not meant to contain or subdue the revolutionary impulse, but rather to offer a forward-looking vision and to lay the foundations of diversity for future political and social engagement.",
    des18:
      "It is also clear that revolutions can unleash counter-revolutionary energies that work against their founding principles. We have witnessed such dangers in the aftermath of the Tunisian and Egyptian revolutions. The sudden rise and mobilisation of religious fundamentalism in both countries illustrates how revolutionary movements remain vulnerable to being hijacked, and how their democratic aspirations can be thwarted. Political Islam is capable of distorting the original motives that inspired revolutionary action, transforming them into new instruments of repression—not unlike those wielded by the very regimes they sought to overthrow.",

    description:
      "At a time when popular uprisings across the Arab world intensify in their call for freedom, social justice, and an end to the tyranny and exploitation practised by authoritarian regimes, we are confronted with a striking contradiction in how different movements and ideologies understand the very notion of freedom.",
    des1: "Among these, political Islam presents itself as the most fitting project for societies where the majority profess the Islamic faith. Yet in doing so, it excludes all who do not share its beliefs or vision—advancing a narrow political framework that, in essence, mirrors the same authoritarianism it claims to oppose.",
    des2: "To realise its project, political Islam begins with the Islamisation of everyday life—seeking to permeate all aspects of social and personal existence. It aims to subjugate the individual through the imposition of rules and norms set by those who call themselves scholars of Islam. In this vision, the individual is not recognised as an autonomous being but merely as a component of the collective.",
    des3: "As for justice and equality, they are not extended to non-Muslims—whether they are of Muslim origin but have chosen a different worldview, or whether they belong to other faiths altogether. Political Islam divides the world into two spheres: that of Muslims, and that of non-Muslims, the latter of whom must be subdued and brought under the authority of the former.",
    des4: "Other ideologies, such as Arab nationalism—though now lacking a strong popular base—are equally unable to provide a theoretical framework that guarantees justice and equality among the region’s diverse ethnic groups. Their slogans often erase or marginalise distinct identities such as the Kurds, Amazigh, and others who have the full right to preserve their languages, cultural heritage, and unique ways of life.",
    des5: "Before we can meaningfully address the concepts of liberty and justice, we must first consider the foundations that unite individuals within a single society—a shared cultural framework that encompasses all segments of the population without discrimination. This collective culture is shaped by what might be termed a 'mental universe'—a shared cognitive structure composed of symbols, principles, and mutual interests that bind people together and foster a sense of belonging.",
    des6: "But what exactly constitutes this 'mental universe'? It consists of images, ideas, and words that circulate unconsciously in daily life. These are mental representations stored in our collective memory, absorbed from birth through external conditioning. We do not choose when these stored images appear, nor do we always control our response to them.",
    des7: "Yet this is not to suggest we are powerless before these inherited mental constructs. Storing something in long-term memory and recalling it later requires, at some level, implicit consent to its content. We are capable of revisiting these representations, examining them consciously, and deciding whether to accept or reject them. However, this process is only possible within an environment that protects the individual’s right to think, speak, and criticise freely—what we might call a 'free space'.",
    des8: "Social life is, by nature, a mixture of conflicting psychological tendencies: a desire for competition, which drives progress, and a tendency towards cooperation, which fosters social cohesion and stability. Mutual interest is thus key to survival, but interest alone is not enough. It must be paired with intelligence—the kind that produces ethical frameworks capable of ensuring justice for all, without discrimination.",
    des9: "Awareness—of both our external surroundings and our internal psychological structures—is what enables us to recognise others and forge new foundations for coexistence. This depends on our ability to create shared interests among individuals and between communities. But such innovation can only occur through a deeper knowledge—one that dismantles the religious and ideological barriers that reinforce divisions.",
    des10:
      "Nationalist ideologies assert their supremacy over other ethnicities; patriotism emphasises national uniqueness; familial loyalties reinforce social stratification; and religious doctrines proclaim their own chosen status: the Muslim thanks God for the 'blessing' of Islam; the Christian sees himself as a beloved child of the divine; the Jew as one chosen by God. All of these frameworks operate on the logic of distinction—claiming for themselves a moral right to dominate or marginalise others.",
    des11:
      "Such notions are wholly incompatible with the idea of free individual space and the principle of equality before the law. Thus, we may conclude that the path to freedom begins with knowledge and awareness—concepts that stand in direct opposition to the tenets of political Islam and dominant regional ideologies.",
    des12:
      "True freedom begins with an independent capacity for thought: thought unbound by inherited mental representations imposed for specific ends. As Henri Laborit once suggested, perhaps we should replace the ideals of 'freedom' and 'equality' with 'awareness' and 'knowledge'. These are the true foundations of tolerance and dialogue—both within societies and across them.",
    des13:
      "And perhaps, one day, we will reach a broader humanist understanding that transcends geography and nationhood. Perhaps, one day, we will go even further—towards an expanded vision of humanity that recognises the right of all living beings to exist and thrive.",

    des2: "These fundamentalist movements not only benefitted from the suffocating conditions endured by their targeted social structures; more significantly, they found themselves thriving within a vast cultural vacuum. Arab regimes, in their ruthless pursuit of systematic repression against intellectuals and activists, inadvertently carved out a gaping chasm between the public and those intellectuals who retreated behind the gates of an elitist ghetto. That withdrawal only deepened their disconnect from the general populace.",
    des3: "One of the consequences of this intellectual ghettoisation was the emergence of a discursive and linguistic impasse, marked by the use of abstruse terminology and complex rhetoric. This, in turn, became an added barrier fuelling the rupture between intellectuals and the public. The language they employed lacked the mental imagery necessary to reach and resonate with the everyday individual. Psychological studies have illuminated this phenomenon—often referred to as the “independence complex”—which suggests that ideas evolve into independent cognitive units before they can be absorbed. From a neuropsychological standpoint, ideas influence individuals only when mediated through emotions. Abstract concepts must first be transformed into sensory images, which then coalesce into a psychological experience capable of leaving a lasting imprint on the mind.",
    des4: "Taking the Tunisian revolutionary experience as an example—a movement sparked by the spontaneous uprising of young men and women—it is vital to recall that this revolt did not emerge from a void, nor was it solely the consequence of Bouazizi’s self-immolation. Rather, it unfolded in a climate of intense tension, to which Bouazizi’s tragic act added fuel.",
    des5: "This uprising could not have endured without the support of several enabling factors along the way. Chief among them was the role played by the new media. A prominent group on social networks known as Takriz had, for many years, garnered a considerable following by grounding their posts and blogs in the tangible realities of Tunisian youth.",
    des6: "Founded in 1998 on the Internet by a group of Tunisian youths using various pseudonyms, Takriz began with two core members and gradually expanded into a movement with tangible influence over the daily lives of countless young Tunisians. One major element that bolstered the connection between Takriz and successive generations of youth was the group’s use of street-inspired slang—language devoid of decorum or pretension. At times, their expressions bordered on the vulgar, perhaps deliberately so, as a way to capture attention and resonate more directly with their audience. Their goal was to bring down the oppressive Tunisian regime, and the group’s administrators remained faithful to that mission, avoiding the lure of public accolades. They played a pivotal role in galvanising and coordinating the January uprising.",
    des7: "This brings us back to our initial point—the rupture between Arab intellectuals and the general public, a breach that paved the way for Islamist movements to flourish and embed themselves within the susceptible minds of disillusioned youth. These movements not only grew in influence but deepened the sense of abandonment felt by a generation who increasingly resembled a forsaken child.",
    des8: "Under such circumstances, Islamists found it easier to establish ties with broad segments of society, largely because they had social programmes, financial resources, and a mastery of emotionally charged language. This is the language of emotion—of indistinct, uncritical thought. In stark contrast, most intellectuals clung to a convoluted, inaccessible discourse laden with affected expression, readily excluding any ideas that failed to align with their worldview.",
    des9: "Among the other reasons that facilitated the proliferation of Islamist fundamentalism, perhaps the most critical was a deeply entrenched scepticism towards the project of Arab nationalism. Islamists were, to a great extent, the only ones who succeeded in capitalising on the collective sense of defeat among Arab nations and their longing for an identity that transcended national borders. This erosion of trust stemmed, in part, from the way Arab liberation movements were contained—diverted by the opening of external warfronts—and the subsequent imposition of a perpetual state of emergency. This cultivated a general climate of fear and led to the people’s ultimate surrender to authoritarian rulers.",
    des10:
      "Thus, it became easy for Islamist movements to stoke the psychological need for a historic victory and offer a sense of identity that could replace the failed Arab nationalist dream. In doing so, they encouraged people to forsake their Arab identity in favour of a broader religious affiliation.",
    des11:
      "It is high time for these nations to confront the reality before them, abandon collective identities, and embrace the primacy of the individual in order to reclaim a wider space for freedom. Progress will then be achieved through the emancipation of individuals within a broader societal context. No one can offer others what they themselves lack. Individual fulfilment and self-sufficiency are essential prerequisites to attaining this vision.",
    des12:
      "Let us now consider another factor that aided the rise of Islamists: the double standards and double-speak adopted by many Western governments. On the one hand, they boast of democratic values and profess an unwavering commitment to human rights; on the other, they sustain alliances with authoritarian regimes that share their strategic interests. For instance, while the West—and particularly the United States—frequently condemns human rights abuses, little is said about the violations perpetrated by their close allies, such as the Saudi royal family, which rules its people with an iron fist.",
    des13:
      "Saudi Arabia is by no means the sole violator of human rights in the world. I focus on it here because it is the epicentre of Islamist ideology and the primary financial backer of movements seeking to Islamise Arab and other societies alike.",
    des14:
      "In my view, it is impossible to stem the tide of fundamentalist Islamism without a decisive stance from the West. There must be an end to the unchecked power and influence of its autocratic allies. These regimes must be isolated, and all diplomatic ties with them—Saudi Arabia foremost among them—must be unequivocally severed.",
    des15:
      "Now is the moment for the West—and for us—to place our trust in the younger generations who are demanding change. They are the new artisans of destiny. The young men and women of Tunisia and Egypt have demonstrated the merit of that trust by overcoming not only their dictators but also the passivity of their own intellectuals. They have emerged as the true thought leaders of the Arab world—educators to those still perched upon rhetorical thrones and clinging to outdated expressions and ideas disconnected from the lived realities of their societies. These young revolutionaries have also managed to surprise Western politicians and disrupt their long-standing arrogance and illusion of control over the destinies of others.",
    des16:
      "This article summarises a symposium (held on 9 February 2011) in which I participated alongside several speakers at the Société de la Presse Française. In my intervention, I explored the close relationship between oppressive regimes and the rise of Islamist movements throughout the Arab world. I also explained how these regimes managed to survive by persuading Western governments that their stability served as the last defence against the further spread of Islamism.",

    des1: "Now that the Tunisian anti-power virus has begun to take effect, it must swiftly seek vaccines to counter smaller, emerging viruses disguised in religious thought. In doing so, this nascent new consciousness may discover a viable path towards life.",
    des2: "There is little doubt that Tunisian society possesses a robust immune system capable of resisting the trap of religious delirium. This immunity and predisposition may stem from various factors, foremost among them a fifty-year foundation built on a system relatively close to Western secularism. Let us not forget that Tunisian women have, for a long time, enjoyed civil rights and liberties still denied to their counterparts in virtually all other Arab nations. This fact alone has fortified the country’s resistance to the religious infectious fungus.",
    des3: "Tunisia’s battle is not yet over. The struggle for life—and the struggle of life—continues. Yet, it has already succeeded in exporting its triumph over the invisible frontiers of fear to other Arab states. The Tunisian domino has toppled into Egypt, despite the significant differences between the two, not least Egypt’s vulnerability to organised Islamic thought, deeply entrenched within its social fabric and openly seeking to extend its influence and seize political power. Despite these setbacks, we must support revolutionary movements regardless of their ultimate outcomes—and prepare ourselves for any potential assault from the religious virus.",
    des4: "Before we ask what might come next, or contemplate the unknown destinies of angry crowds, we must turn our attention to more immediate and visible threats. These revolts are unfolding within a climate of heightened religious sentiment. Islamic movements will not hesitate to seize upon the opportunity to ride the wave of popular protest. In that regard, they are no different from leeches feeding on the blood of the people. They are no different from the tyrants of the region. They will exchange guarantees of safety and dignity for ethereal promises, with no earthly assets, only threats of punishment in the hereafter for anyone who dares reclaim their lost self.",
    des5: "Perhaps the time has come for diverse forces—regardless of creed or conviction—to unite under a shared desire and vision for an earthly future. Perhaps now is the time to draw up a carefully considered strategy to confront and contain religious thought, without hesitation or compromise.",

Such a programme may prove to be the best safeguard against the rigid Islamic cancer fuelled by Saudi oil money.",
    des8: "There is no denying that many factors have allowed this deeply entrenched cancer to take root in the minds of wretched, hungry peoples who have long suffered from war, colonisation and oppression—and who now face a gaping intellectual void that religion fills with saccharine dreams and promises.",
    des9: "Equally undeniable is the organisational prowess of Islamist groups. They are skilled in recruitment and in exploiting the psychological wounds of these long-oppressed societies to advance their own agendas—and those of their religious leaders, who are the primary beneficiaries of such social structures. Naturally, these organisations flourish under the shadow of authoritarian and corrupt states that have robbed their people of every liberty and left them only with ruins and economic collapse. The combination of all these conditions has rendered the region a fertile ground for the cultivation of religious poison.",
    des10:
      "It is all too easy for these organisations to cloak themselves in the garb of purity, virtue and righteousness—deceiving nations with hollow promises of a brighter tomorrow. They rekindle illusions of a bygone Islamic golden age, an era of bounty, affluence and bliss. Dreamers are promised an empty triumph over all adversity.",

      "I believe it is imperative to expose how history is being twisted and misrepresented. We must shine a light on the true causes of this much-lauded 'Islamic awakening', which was not born of the cultural heritage of the Arabian Peninsula. The achievements attributed to the Umayyads and Abbasids were in fact the result of centuries of diverse civilisational amalgamation across the Middle East and beyond—including Egypt—long before the rise of Islam.",
    des13:

      "Fundamentalist Islamist thought has succeeded in recruiting a core of marginalised individuals and reviving the memory of jihad in the minds of the vulnerable—forming a chorus of suicidal souls, eager to kill and be killed. While suicide may remain an individual act, a ‘choice’, claiming the right to kill is unequivocally a crime against humanity.",
    des15:
      "To counter this notion, we must make peace with the idea of death—when life is rendered unbearable. In the shadows of cruelty and deprivation, we must revisit the ancient wisdom of the Japanese samurai, who, when faced with crisis and forced to weigh life against death, would choose death with clarity and courage.",

      "An analysis of authoritarianism, fear, and uprising in the Arab world, using Tunisia's revolution as a turning point.",
    des1: "For decades, Arab regimes have succeeded in numbing the collective consciousness of their peoples through a range of tactics: repression, violence, exile—whether abroad or beneath the soil—and the systematic marginalisation of those who remained on the land. All this has served one ultimate goal: the entrenchment of absolute power. In pursuit of this goal, these governments have deliberately silenced knowledge and stifled information that runs counter to the principle of domination, preventing it from reaching the public domain.",
    des2: "At the root of this insatiable urge to dominate and subjugate lies a fragile ego—an anxious self, lost in its own narrow corridors. It is an ego impoverished in knowledge, famished for biological and psychological gratification, and too weak to find its place within the collective.",
    des3: "These regimes suffer from a form of political neurosis, projecting onto the world the drama of their internal disarray. They draw upon their cultural surroundings to construct an illusory heroic archetype, one they graft onto their own deficient sense of self—an ego incapable of dialogue or exchange with others. As a result, they constantly require conflict, whether internal or—if geography and geopolitics allow—external, to assert their dominance and tighten their grip on those beneath their rule.",
    des4: "Despotism often enlists the beast of religious fundamentalism, subtly and strategically. It is deployed as needed—a weapon of fear, a brittle stick used to bludgeon opponents.",
    des5: "Arab regimes, without exception, have played a significant role in nurturing Islamic fundamentalist movements. Cloaked in a superficial secularism, they deceive themselves into believing in a legitimacy they once seized by force.",
    des6: "Thus, those who live under ignorant, hypocritical regimes—regimes that feed religious fundamentalism—are right to rebel. It is a right as basic as survival itself. And if the cost of breaking free from authoritarianism must be a period of fundamentalist rule, that cost is no greater than the deathlike stillness these embalmed regimes have imposed upon us.",
    des7: "Better that we prepare ourselves, however grim the next phase may be, than to be dragged into it unprepared—from one form of death to another, more insidious. Iraq offers a cautionary tale.",
    des8: "Once the wall of fear is broken—even just once—new uprisings become not only possible but inevitable. Fear loses its grip with each blow struck against it.",
    des9: "The Tunisian uprising is the convulsion of a body on the verge of death—lashing out to shatter death’s grip, reclaiming the right to live, and rejecting the quietude of the grave. It is the collective will refusing to vanish.",
    des10:
      "When the conditions for a dignified life are stripped away, when the individual is reduced to a passive recipient—a scapegoat for the nourishment of a tyrannical ego—then the gamble of change becomes not only an act of hope, but a necessary step. Such a leap demands the annihilation of fear: the fear of the unknown, the fear of the Islamist spectre.",
    des11:
      "Perhaps these societies must pass through the dark tunnel of religious fundamentalism, fall into the claws of the monster, and emerge with newfound immunity. The encounter may serve as a kind of vaccine—preparing them for future battles against authoritarian viruses, whether embodied in clergy or crowned in thrones.",
    des12:
      "We all dream of personal freedoms—of a life where individuals can sing their own songs freely. But this is only possible when ownership of the self is restored—when the individual regains the right to live and to die. Only then can the imagination begin to soar, wandering unbound. This rebirth of imagination must be preceded by individual fulfilment; only through it can we transcend the collective’s cognitive boundaries and take flight, a bird traversing all cultures.",

To overcome such disorders and uproot authoritarian thought at its core, we must confront what we fear. Only by facing it can we dissolve the deep-seated mental images infused with accumulated dread of the unknown.",
    des16:
      "Turning to the “coping” theory proposed by Folkman and Lazarus—which helps us understand how individuals behave within their environments—we find that people are not passive before external demands.

      "Mohamed Bouazizi’s spontaneous act of defiance against the degrading conditions in his society—and the wave of strikes and protests it ignited across Tunisia—marks a defining moment. It reminds us that, at times, death can become the threshold for a new beginning: the inception of a life project born out of rupture.",
    des2: "What is unfolding in Tunisia today is not merely a reaction—it is the first glimmer of consciousness after a long coma. A lucid recognition of deprivation, and a deliberate choice to resist in pursuit of dignity, fulfilment, and sufficiency. It is the awakening of a society long resigned to silence.",
    des3: "Bouazizi’s case is not an anomaly. It reflects a collective condition endured by countless young men and women across the Arab world. It is the paralysis that comes with powerlessness, the erosion of even the most basic individual freedoms under regimes that know only the language of domination—where life and death are weaponised in equal measure.",
    des4: "When freedom becomes intertwined with death, when the homeland begins to resemble an earthly hell—a vision not far removed from the believer’s imagined inferno—it becomes clear that life has ceased to be long before any true journey of exploration or meaning could begin. And it is precisely that journey—towards meaning—that fuels life.",
    des5: "Many of us cling to life despite its misery, accepting subjugation, self-effacement, and withdrawal. Our demands are reduced to satisfying the most primal needs, and the individual becomes trapped in a condition lower than that of animals—who, at the very least, live in harmony with nature. This compels us to re-evaluate the foundational meaning of life. Perhaps, then, we might rise—if only marginally—to the level of creatures that live with balance and instinctual coherence.",
    des6: "For centuries, humanity has wrestled with the fear of death by constructing fantasies of an illusory eternity, forgetting to harness its inner forces to seek fulfilment in this life. In this process, earthly life was replaced by the promise of eternal life—a compensatory illusion. And just as one approaches fulfilment and begins to acquire greater freedom, they retreat into this illusion, surrendering instead to the comfort of death.",
    des7: "It is from here that we must examine the state of the individual in Arab societies, crushed beneath the weight of an unholy trinity: a wrathful God, a tyrannical ruler, and a repressive society. The suffering of individuals in such contexts mirrors, in many ways, the believers’ vision of hell. So we are right to ask: what does life mean for those who are denied its very pleasures?",
    des8: "I remain convinced that life and freedom are inextricably bound. They converge at the point of knowledge, the freedom to choose, and the acceptance of responsibility. While our awareness is often shaped by the values imposed by our environment, we retain the capacity to derive new ideas from diverse sources—ideas that allow us to choose, reject, or transform prevailing norms. From such autonomy, genuine responsibility emerges.",
    des9: "This autonomy, however, can only be born from an individual process of fulfilment—beginning with the satisfaction of primal needs, and gradually evolving within a social framework that offers rewards to encourage the individual’s participation and integration.",
    des10:
      "It is these rewards that compel individuals to embrace collective values, work to perpetuate them, and even sacrifice in their name. But when such rewards vanish, so too do the meanings and values the collective once instilled. Without them, life loses coherence—especially when the collective exercises total control, extinguishing the last refuge of individuality: the imagination.",
    des11:
      "At this point, the individual loses all internal motivation to pursue fulfilment or sufficiency. As Henri Laborit observed, “Satisfaction can only be attained through an act of fulfilment. When fulfilment becomes impossible, crisis ensues—manifesting as violence when it affects an individual, or as revolution when it affects a broader class.”",
    des12:
      "For this reason, I believe it is legitimate—indeed essential—to re-examine the meaning of life and death within Arab societies, where even the right to meet one’s basic needs is absent. Can life be defended when its primary engine—desire, drive, fulfilment—has been severed?",
    des13:
      "To my mind, what separates life from death is precisely the awareness of both—and of freedom. Life, without fragments of freedom, becomes void. It is the consciousness of one’s condition, and the freedom to choose a path towards fulfilment, that give life its worth.",
    des14:
      "This is why, in some circumstances, suicide aligns more closely with the principle of life than with its negation—especially when it emerges under the weight of authoritarianism, ideological suffocation, or a religious order that throttles human fulfilment. In such contexts, choosing death becomes an act of rebirth—for others—and a moment of clarity and liberation for the individual.",
    des15:
      "It is well known that the collective invented the illusion of security to draw the individual into its fold. It has also devised countless mechanisms—varying from society to society—depending on how much freedom it permits. The collective will always innovate new tools to preserve its dominance, for every social system is ultimately a closed system, circulating information and values within its own orbit.",
    des16:
      "Yet we must understand the primary driving force behind these systems: fulfilment first, then the hope of sufficiency, both arranged within a rigid hierarchy. When both are absent, the individual remains trapped in a state of perpetual torment, suspended between life and death.",
    des17:
      "This is the condition of all individuals living under authoritarianism in its various forms across the Arab world. And that is why we must honour every act—whether personal or collective—that seeks liberation, even if we disagree with the methods employed.",

Residual ideas inherited from bygone centuries—ideas that hurl us back to prehistoric times—must be identified and discredited. This pursuit of understanding is not driven by a desire to respect these beliefs, but rather by the necessity to expose their savage origins and explain the extent to which they remain an entangled, confused snarl in the minds of individuals and groups who continue to uphold them.",
    des2: "Such was the stance of archaeologist and historian Salomon Reinach, who devoted his life’s work to dispelling the mists of residual beliefs across cultures. I took the liberty, in the paragraph above, of paraphrasing this idea from his voluminous study Cultes, mythes et religions (1905–1923). This serves as our entry point into the central theme of this article: an inquiry into the origins of the idea of god.",
    des3: "A careful examination of anthropological research and studies on the origins of myth enables us to uncover the deep roots of religion and the belief systems that predate the emergence of the god-concept. These pagan beliefs ought not to be dissociated from the history of religions, for they constituted fertile ground for their birth and growth. If, at their origin, religions fed upon and evolved from the infantile and naïve imagination of early civilisations, they later acquired strength and eventually imposed themselves as powerful authorities over hearts and minds.",
    des4: "The notion of a primitive god finds its source in the concept of the totem. Many anthropologists agree on the universality of the totemic system, which was by no means limited to the native populations of Australia and the Americas.",
    des5: "Let us begin with a brief overview of the totemic system itself. It is a tribal structure grounded in a series of taboos, which may be summarised—according to Durkheim, Reinach, Frazer and others—as practices centred around the veneration of a chosen animal, or in rare instances, a plant or specific inanimate object.",
    des6: "The totem, at its core, rests upon an elusive and enigmatic contract based on shared beliefs between a particular group of people and the animals under their guardianship. Reinach observed that the totemic system arose alongside archaic Homo sapiens. This early veneration of the totem animal waned and eventually disappeared as human societies transitioned from the hunter-gatherer phase to agriculture and sedentary life.",
    des7: "Studies examining this shift have identified strikingly similar traits and processes across cultures and civilisations, from ancient Greece to Egypt and Syria. Within the totemic system, the tribal animal is designated as an object of prohibition. It may only be killed on a specific day of the year, and always in the presence of the entire tribe. Special ceremonies and rituals—marked by scenes of mourning and grief—accompany the slaughter of the totem animal.",
    des8: "A close reading of the reports compiled by Spencer and Gillen on the subject of totemism highlights some of its direct consequences, such as the emergence of exogamy and the gradual prohibition of incest. Reinach also noted that, in some civilisations, the later emergence of the personified god was accompanied by human sacrifice intended to resurrect and renew life. These practices trace their origins to the sanctity of the totem animal. Frazer’s work on tribal traditions—many of which survive today as rituals stripped of their original emotional significance—shows that such rituals were grounded in the belief that supernatural powers were transferred to the human who consumed the totem animal’s flesh. From an anthropological standpoint, these rites were underpinned by the idea that the flesh of the totem animal—the tribe’s protector—bestowed extraordinary powers upon the consumer. Remnants of this belief can still be found today in various cultures. In certain regions of China, for example, the genitals of specific animals are consumed in the belief that they enhance sexual potency.",
    des9: "It is worth reminding readers that, for the Māori, male genitals symbolise life, whereas female genitals represent death. In some Chinese traditions, the consumption of male animal genitals is likewise associated with vitality and energy. Here, we must underline the dialectical relationship between internal psychological drives and the external experiences that led many societies to adopt such beliefs.",
    des10:
      "One may draw some consolation from the thought that early humans’ ignorance of the biological mechanisms of reproduction led them to develop notions of reincarnation through animals and plants. The earliest hypothesis explaining the development of totemism rests on the idea of a continuous flow of life between humans and their totem animals. The totem animal was considered a full member of the tribe and endowed with sacred qualities.",
    des11:
      "Yet from this original sacred regard for the totem animal, we eventually moved to indiscriminate and collective slaughter. The killing of the totem animal was not seen as a sacrifice to any deity—for the simple reason that the concept of god had not yet been born.",
    des12:
      "The notion of sacrifice to the gods emerged gradually, alongside humanity’s slow progression from savagery to agrarian life. With this shift, animals began to lose their sacred aura, and more significantly, humans began to develop feelings of revulsion towards certain creatures.",
    des13:
      "If we consult the writings of Robertson Smith and Salomon Reinach on the sacralisation of animals among the ancient peoples of Greece, Rome, Syria and Egypt, we find, for instance, that wild boars were considered sacred in ancient Syria. This may shed light on the origin of the prohibition against pork among Jews and Muslims, both of whom originally lived in that part of the world. The emotions and affects originally associated with the sanctity of the animal gradually inverted, yet the notion of prohibition persisted. It is important to note that feelings of disgust and hatred can, at times, serve as necessary tools to sever our emotional connection to the original sacred significance of the totem animal.",

    des1: "Let us begin with a brief glance at the process by which individual inferences are abstracted into sweeping generalisations. We know that these personal inferences consist of a composite of cognitive images lodged in long-term memory. These images retain the emotional and affective charge present when the original inferences were made. At a later stage, the brain reorganises images with shared attributes stored in the latent memory, and these re-emerge in the form of actual behaviour.",
    des2: "Undoubtedly, each one of us perceives reality through the lens of our individual imagination, the quality of which varies according to our experiences. What distinguishes a conscious individual—one who seeks to enrich their knowledge and understanding—from another who remains shackled to imposed experiences is this: the desire to expand one’s imagination through science and knowledge, rather than yielding to the consequences of ignorance and sweeping generalisations.",
    des3: "Primitive humans instinctively prohibited that which they did not understand, as a means of avoiding danger—an entirely rational survival response. The taboo did not arise from an individual or collective intent to regulate social life. For this reason, in its early stages, the taboo was not associated with punishment meted out by the group to those who violated it. Rather, it was believed that the taboo itself could bring about death to anyone who touched or approached it, whether deliberately or inadvertently. The taboo did not denote an action; instead, it implied prohibition in a fundamental sense—it acted not as a motivator, but as a restraint. This is the key distinction between the taboo and the later emergence of religious laws, which transformed the original meaning of taboo into systems of moral and legal codes. The affects and psychological states of fear and dread underpin the rise of the taboo, which functioned as a totalising and uniform explanation for all recurring phenomena caused by the natural world.",
    des4: "Let us return to the relationship between primitive humans and nature. While today we might regard this bond as a sign of philosophical or ecological advancement, it did not stem from any conscious recognition that humans formed part of nature, nor from any sense of harmony with other living beings. Rather, it was rooted in psychological states shaped by a deep sense of powerlessness and lack of control over the forces of nature.",
    des5: "There is no doubt that the human need for many ancient myths and fables has waned over time. Perhaps humanity simply grew weary of repeating the same failed experiences, eventually realising that rituals grounded in sorcery and shamanism had not succeeded in mastering the external world (what we now refer to as the external or empirical experience). When this external experience clashes with inner consciousness, a confused mind—unable to resolve the consequences of this confrontation between inner and outer forces—often defaults to supernatural interpretations.",
    des6: "Historical records offer numerous examples of how, during the post-agricultural and pastoral stages of evolution, humans used animals to detect danger or locate water sources. These early humans may have come to recognise the keenness of animal senses. The Roman historian Tacitus, for instance, observed that ancient Jews venerated donkeys, referencing a tale in which a wild variant of this animal led Moses to a water spring. In the same account, Tacitus offers insight into the sacrificial ritual involving a calf—seen as an act of vengeance against the ancient Egyptians, who revered the sacred bull Apis.",
    des7: "From this, we may trace the roots of the totemic system to the very regions in which the Abrahamic religions would later arise. The totemic structure evolved alongside each stage of human development, from hunting and gathering to agriculture and settled farming.",
    des8: "Returning to the notion of taboo and its connection with totemism, we must consider its profound influence on the Abrahamic faiths. The taboo was defined by the prohibition of contact with the sacred totem. In some ancient tribes, and as noted by Durkheim, a woman who had just given birth was considered a taboo object for forty days due to the presence of blood—believed to be the essence or spirit of life. Here, we encounter a link with the notion of blood ties, which continue to underpin tribal loyalties and emotional allegiances. This association between taboo and blood offers a vital clue to the concept of the primitive god. Even today, menstrual and postpartum blood remain subjects of prohibition in many Muslim cultures, where women are not permitted to pray or fast during such periods. As outlined in the first part of this article, the feeling of disgust and corruption tied to the taboo stems from a psychological reaction to the loss of its original sacred dimension. This unconscious association is powerful and not easily resolved, yet it continues to manifest in cultural and religious practices around the world.",
    des9: "And since we are on the subject of women, it is worth mentioning the Roman pagan tradition of whipping women with rods—an ancient ritual that endured until at least the 5th century and coincides, in modern times, with Valentine’s Day. On the fifteenth day of the second month, young men (and later priests) would roam the streets of Ancient Rome with rods, flogging women they encountered. It was believed that such flagellation promoted fertility. This practice was not confined to the Roman Lupercalia festival but echoes other traditions recorded by anthropologists like Thompson, Frazer, and Reinach, where animals were flogged to enhance their reproductive capabilities.",
    des10:
      "Given the deep entrenchment of taboo in the fabric of social organisation, it is important to consider how its meaning has shifted over the centuries, and how its influence continues in laws governing punishment and moral codes. Transgressors of the taboo were seen as contaminated, and punishment served to prevent that contamination from spreading to the wider group.",
    des11:
      "This fear of contagion became the primary catalyst for the emergence of guilt within human societies, linking closely with the idea of purification and the expiation of sin. In the Akakios tribe in Africa, sinners undergo rigorous rituals to rid themselves of guilt. They confess to the tribal sorcerer, who oversees a ceremony beginning with the sinner vomiting—a symbolic purging of inner corruption. This association between the physical act of emptying the body and the spiritual notion of cleansing suggests that guilt was once conceived as a corporeal affliction, not a matter of conscience. Here again, we encounter the concept of the scapegoat: rather than punishing the guilty party, an innocent animal is sacrificed to redeem the sin.",
    des12:
      "The scapegoat motif appears in many societies that pre-date the Abrahamic religions. Plutarch recounts a public punishment in the city of Chaeronea in which a slave’s genitals were whipped while his tormentors cried: ‘Depart from our city, oh famine, and come to us, oh health and plenty!’",
    des13:
      "Though these customs may seem absurd to us today, they emerged during the agricultural phase of human evolution. Totemic remnants were gradually transformed into spiritual doctrines, evolving into ideas of divine punishment and reward, and manifesting in religious rituals—from scapegoating to collective prayer for rain. Climate, too, played a crucial role in maintaining these totemic beliefs. More significantly, however, we find that the natural and cultural environment continues to reinforce them. In societies where basic needs and desires are met, the longing for deeper understanding tends to flourish. The fulfilment of biological necessities often paves the way for a more vibrant and inquisitive intellectual life.",

    screens: "Al-Hiwar al-Mutamaddin",
    description:
      "Published on 21 November 2010, this article explores the psychological, historical, and conceptual challenges surrounding secularism in Arab societies.",
    des1: "From time to time, proposals resurface affirming the inevitability of secularism within Arab societies. These are swiftly met with louder and more numerous voices from opposing religious factions, accompanied by cries of denunciation from within the public sphere, protesting what they perceive as a grand conspiracy that has been meticulously woven for centuries against their communities.",
    des2: "We clearly observe, with some consistency, the inflamed glorification prevalent among individuals in these groups, expressed through a repeated vocabulary grounded in fantastical beliefs—chief among them the notion that the entire world conspires against their lands. And why wouldn’t they believe so, when they consider themselves the chosen children of heaven, uniquely selected above all others? This condition bears resemblance to that of a patient crushed by his environment, who, under mounting pressure, resorts to chronic hallucinations in an effort to compensate for what he lacks.",
    des3: "It reflects a deep insufficiency experienced by the individual across all dimensions, and a severe sense of obliteration before the collective structure—be it religious authority, familial bonds, or traditional power. As a result, we often see individuals repeating, almost mechanically, the terminology deeply implanted in their consciousness by the group to which they belong.",
    des4: "For this reason, I believe we must cease the repetitive invocation of the term “secularism”, as it triggers states of panic and dread among members of these collectives. Rather, I find it necessary to briefly revisit history, in the hope of extracting useful lessons from the experiences of those who came before us—lessons that might help us conserve our energy instead of squandering it on repetition, and direct it instead towards finding solutions to the tragic reality facing the individual and, subsequently, the community. This may be achieved by avoiding terminology charged with repugnant emotional connotations, for our collectives are in urgent need of prolonged psychological therapy—therapy capable of dismantling the internal barriers and relieving the chronic rigidity they suffer from, in order to cultivate a capacity for intellectual flexibility.",
    des5: "Let us take a historical view of change within societal structures. We would find that new laws and systems, in any given society, are almost always rooted in its own cultural and historical context. Even the most revolutionary legislations carry a conservative element—a thread that binds them to the fabric of the collective. Therefore, researchers and those concerned with improving their societies must first study, in depth, the consciousness of their people, so that they may learn how to touch the emotional core of the individual and carry them towards a promised future.",
    des6: "And perhaps, before calling for a specific system or structure, there is a prior need to develop new concepts and frameworks that may gradually circulate among the population. These, in turn, may one day provide the foundation for a coherent system or law under which the society can unite.",
    des7: "Returning to the rejection of the word “secularism”, I would argue that the issue lies in the concept itself. Before we engage with it in a superficial manner, we must acknowledge that secularism is not a fixed definition. Its essence lies in its mutability, its adaptability to the transformations of life. The insistence of some on assigning it a single, static meaning exposes us to another problem: the authoritarianism of epistemological ego. Before demanding the implementation of any institutional system, individuals within these collectives must first learn how to swim in the depths of language, to navigate freely across its meanings and dimensions.",
    des8: "Before embarking on a brief historical overview of secularism, allow me a simple question: what is the purpose of fabricating a collective formula so rigid and immobile? Would that not amount to reproducing religious dogma in the form of equivalent civil legislation?",
    des9: "Has secularism in France, for example, remained true to the original principles it established during the French Revolution? Evidently not. These principles have evolved gradually from the eighteenth century up to the early twentieth. Secularism began with basic premises rooted in equal rights for individuals, which slowly spread to encompass the very structure of the state. This culminated in the 1905 law on the separation of church and state.",
    des10:
      "It is important to note, however, that French secularism in 1905 differs in several respects from its present-day form. Today, secularism manifests more assertively in French society’s rejection of all religious symbols—not solely Islamic, but those of all faiths. We must also realise that secularism will never settle into a final form. It is a perpetually shifting phenomenon, anchored in the fundamental principle of freedom of thought and expression.",
    des11:
      "Secularism still has a long road ahead in its pursuit of broader individual freedoms, in helping people liberate themselves from all forms of enslavement. Enslavement is not confined to the domain of deity or religion; it extends to the realm of consumerism, to repetitive, uninspired labour devoid of intellectual engagement. It is this that fuels the diminished self—an ego trapped beneath the authority of servitude.",
    des12:
      "We need not argue over the term or the label that facilitates meaningful change, as long as it ultimately serves the individual and strikes a balance between their needs and those of their collective. Thus, we must continue our search for a new concept to serve this aim. We must transcend the enslavement of vocabulary, and exercise creativity to reach the emotional and religious affiliations of the group. We must seek to subtly transform emotions themselves, through diverse and intelligent methods, rather than casting people directly into the arms of what they perceive as the enemy of life.",
    des13:
      "We cannot transplant the cultural outcomes of societies vastly different from ours—whether in their religious, political, or economic evolution—and apply them mechanically to our own. What we can do is study and analyse these movements in order to extract the core principles that governed their transformative journeys. From this point, imagination can be unleashed, and creativity can flourish.",
    des14:
      "I believe that the current sectarian fragmentation within our societies provides fertile ground for transformation. This change will not emerge from unity or mutual understanding between sects, but from their very divisions and disorientation. These conditions are the driving force behind the formation of neutral concepts and legislative frameworks capable of guaranteeing individual freedoms.",
    des15:
      "Islam was never the solution. Nor was Christianity. Nor will any rigid legal system ever be. Secularism emerged, in fact, from internal church conflicts, from the desire of some to break free from papal authority in favour of monarchs or emperors. Social, political, and other structural factors joined forces to give rise to the change.",
    des16:
      "Let us not forget that the freedoms Europe now enjoys came at the cost of the bodies of its people. As the anthropologist Frazer noted in his study of so-called “savage” societies: the strength of any group lies in the ability of its members to sacrifice the present for a future capable of fulfilling them—and the same is true of the individual.",
    des17:
      "I did not write this piece out of firm belief in the necessity of individual sacrifice for the group. Perhaps it is because I no longer subscribe to the modern forms of human affiliation—nationhood, homeland, even humanity itself. My allegiance is to life, and to what life embodies in all living beings. Yet I am aware that the flourishing of any collective group must follow that logic.",
    des18:
      "Ultimately, I believe that the beginning of any true transformation lies in freeing ourselves from the tyranny of rigid language, and in abandoning the blind imitation of history. The circumstances that enabled other nations to overcome their authoritarian past and join the flow of life differ drastically—geographically and historically—from those of our own. Perhaps the time has come to stir our psychological responses by inventing new expressions and linguistic structures that are in harmony with the religious and historical texture of our societies.",
    des19:
      "Those who fail to create, to think, to move in step with life’s unfolding momentum, will simply vanish. History—and anthropology—have taught us that life is rooted in evolution; it selects only those elements capable of adapting to its unrelenting transformations.",
    des20:
      "Perhaps it is time for these societies to realise that their fate is extinction if they persist in clinging to static absolutes that conflict with nature’s own order. After all of this, I am left with one final question: what is the true source of this chronic rigidity that governs the fate of these peoples? Might it be an unconscious yearning for immortality at the side of their god? And why not, when they were raised to revere both servitude and death in equal measure?",
    des21:
      "Perhaps the time has come to reconstruct global concepts, to propose new forms of belonging—free of nation, ethnicity, and inherited identity. Perhaps we should support those who wish to fulfil their fantastical desire for suicide and aid them in their journey to be reunited with their deity. Let them choose death if they wish.",
    des22:
      "As for us: You may keep your dead god. We shall embrace our ever-changing life.",

      "Published on 14 September 2010, this article explores the psychological and cultural barriers to intellectual diversity and the necessity of evolving individual thought beyond societal norms.",
    des1: "Following the failure of my “miraculous invention” to dissolve the hymen, and my inability to lead an army to conquer virginity—a failure naturally owed to the ever-watchful guardians of the sexual realm, sworn to thwart any attempt at plundering “masculine treasures”—I was reminded once more that, in our culture, to violate chastity is akin to violating one’s livelihood: both are sacred.",
    des2: "Some of the responses and emails I received revealed a certain incapacity among some readers to grasp the text in its entirety. Their replies were rigid, lifeless, and unable to unpack the symbolism embedded in the title. I suspect this stems from a general cultural tension around engaging with such sensitive subjects.",
    des3: "I've addressed the topic of perception in earlier articles, particularly its failure to comprehend what lies beyond the bounds of the individual ego—especially when the mind instinctively rejects the unfamiliar. Human beings, by nature, gravitate towards repetition. In neuropsychology, this is known as the preference for “affective probability”. As Zajonc explained, the act of selecting any mental representation is governed by a mechanism of preference. Hence, we often find ourselves endlessly replicating our own thoughts and methods, avoiding anything that falls outside our established cognitive patterns.",
    des4: "We frequently hear calls for diversity and the right to difference, couched in lofty slogans such as “freedom of expression”. But before we ask this of others, should we not first question our own capacity to suspend our cognitive egos long enough to read or hear what challenges them?",
    des5: "In my view, the essence of true difference lies in one’s ability to subject their thoughts and behaviours to constant self-critique, thereby attaining a broader awareness. This cannot be achieved while one remains obsessed with inflating the ego through the approval of others.",
    des6: "Let us briefly consider the methodology of thought and analysis in our Arab societies. More often than not, we remain prisoners of a single approach—regardless of whether we identify as proponents or opponents. I believe this stems from the inability of some writers, artists, and thinkers to step beyond the confines imposed either by their audience or by themselves. They become captive to a familiar path and are quick to pass judgement on anything that does not conform to their own intellectual frameworks.",
    des7: "And the matter goes deeper still. The Arab mentality—including its religious variations across sects—is often shaped by an uncreative mindset grounded in repetition and mimicry.",
    des8: "True, the expression of ideas—whether through writing, art, or any meaningful endeavour—ought to carry a sense of commitment. But that commitment should not be confined to a single aim or method. Every purposeful work is, in essence, a product of accumulated personal experience, infused with ideas from various cultures, and brought to life through the force of imaginative creativity.",
    des9: "Before speaking of diverse ideas and varied approaches, we must reflect on the nature of our collective thought from a historical perspective. We’ll find that the religious culture in our region has long been predicated on the notion of “the singular individual”—that is, change occurs only through a handful of exceptional figures.",
    des10:
      "This invites the question: were prophets and messengers merely figureheads moved by hidden powers seeking domination? Or were they rebels who defied the harshness of their environments? In either case, they remain embodiments of a monolithic cultural model—one whose roots persist to this day.",
    des11:
      "We are still searching for a mythical saviour to deliver us from our tragedies by some miraculous means. And many among those who fight for human and women’s rights remain unable to accept diversity in perspective, in analysis, and in solutions.",
    des12:
      "There are no absolute answers, nor singular readings. Change is not brought about merely by urgent desire. It is realised through the emergence of individual groups with differing views—each approaching reality from varied angles, grounding their analyses in multiple disciplines. There is no single lens through which to interpret a concept, no one remedy supported by one study alone—but rather a series of experimental approaches.",
    des13:
      "As for our societies—suspended in a kind of coma—they must first be jolted by powerful shocks before any healing can begin.",
    des14:
      "Before entering any battle, we must first rediscover ourselves—to understand the buried motives that have led us to adopt one mode of thought over another. When creative work becomes a tool for flaunting the ego, then all efforts at remedy become futile. When we approach others through a narcissistic lens, projecting our own concepts and desires onto them, we inevitably abort every sincere attempt—no matter how modest—that might mark the beginning of a collective exit from this narrow tunnel.",
    des15:
      "I believe true change can only emerge by reshaping the psychological fabric of each individual—so they may discover their own distinct and unique nature. Only then can final goals be identified and pursued through individual methodologies that remain flexible and open to evolution.",
    des16:
      "That is why we must first liberate ourselves from the prison of self-evaluation, so we might later free ourselves from the judgement of others. Our journey through life should not be reduced to a mere quest for validation, but rather a long process that begins with aligning our actions with our thoughts, and both with the laws of nature.",
    des17:
      "I won’t prolong this further, but I do wish to clarify something for those readers who, on occasion, project their own egos onto my writings: I do not write to please, nor to glorify my own ego. My writing is an attempt to extract all my mental images—so I may sing as I please, within the orbit of my own goals, whose contours I have only just begun to draw.",

    des1: "I have, for a long time now, heard persistent voices calling for sexual equality in male-dominated societies. I am not an activist in this regard, as I have chosen to live far from that particular struggle, so that one day I might delve into the essence of life in its comprehensive, existential meaning. That said, the ongoing debate has led me to reflect on the subject and attempt to understand some of the obstacles preventing women from lifting themselves out of their dark, stagnant ponds. I believe such transformation will only be possible through a radical shift in feminine behaviour and dreams.",
    des2: "The patriarchal order has long entrenched a masculine construct that serves only its interests. It has installed itself as the ultimate purpose of a woman’s life—her sacred aspiration from early youth—an idea, of course, reinforced by the notion of God and religion.",
    des3: "Undeniably, patriarchy has dehumanised women, reducing them to mechanical slaves who glorify their executioners. Worse still, it has made them enemies of their own bodies and foes to their fellow women. Most so-called advocates of women’s rights are, ironically, among the most aggressive towards other women.",
    des4: "But let us first interrogate the meaning of equality. Before anything else, it implies equal rights and duties—equality in civic life, employment, and citizenship. Yet herein lies the crux: how can a slave offer what they themselves do not possess? Constant pleas and grievances are futile when directed at a male-dominated society whose very structure is built upon exclusion and stratification.",
    des5: "Look closely: the Muslim views himself as God’s beloved, the Christian as a vessel of divine grace. The wealthy regard their material fortune as proof of superiority, believing themselves entitled to privileges others must forfeit. Those who claim intellectual authority, meanwhile, are unable to tolerate unfamiliar ideas—whether scientific, philosophical, or otherwise. They inflate their egos while rejecting what they cannot grasp.",
    des6: "Amidst this grotesque and colourful collective ego, the voice of the feminist—or even of the ordinary woman—is drowned out. Her voice becomes a distorted echo of masculine ideals. She clings to her virginity, not out of personal conviction, but in the hope of gaining male sympathy and validation. She saves it for a romantic moment, a gallant knight, the man of her dreams—as if she were presenting him with a platter of diamonds. She reduces herself to a reproductive organ, making it the cornerstone of her identity. And she lashes out at anyone who dares attempt to liberate her.",
    des7: "It is time to pause and examine the negative role women themselves often play in reinforcing their own subjugation.",
    des8: "Patriarchal society feigns sympathy, insisting that women are unsuited for labour or physical endurance. In the name of compassion, it confines them to the domestic sphere—where they are ostensibly loved and respected, but in reality are humiliated and subjected to the whims of impotent macho men incapable of fulfilling their emotional or physical needs.",
    des9: "Sexism wears a flimsy cloak, barely concealing the hypocrisy of masculine double standards, particularly in the moral codes of religious societies. Morality, in such contexts, is a tool shaped by masculine interests and values.",
    des10:
      "In the West, the feminist struggle has been marked by women’s relentless efforts to secure their rights, often through organised demonstrations. History remembers the names of women who played pivotal roles during moments of upheaval—particularly during WWII, when women entered the workforce en masse and were recognised as an economic force. These feminist demands were supported by collective action and a vibrant literary movement. Yet despite legal reforms and formal equality, the struggle for genuine parity remains ongoing.",
    des11:
      "Now, let us return to women living under patriarchal regimes. Their path forward must include a persistent struggle for civil rights—employment, inheritance, divorce, monogamy, and more. But material participation alone is not enough. Women must engage in a complete act of emancipation—one that includes material and emotional independence.",
    des12:
      "She must no longer see a man as necessary to fulfil her aspirations. Only then will emotional freedom be possible, and that, in turn, demands the abolition of all gendered attributes—maternal instinct, feminine softness, masculine gallantry—all of which perpetuate sexist constructs.",
    des13:
      "In these societies, women are made to feel physiologically inferior. The female reproductive organ is seen as less worthy than the male’s. Such beliefs are not innate but imposed by the culture in which they were raised.",
    des14:
      "That is why I propose that the female reproductive organ be reimagined—not as a symbol of submission, but as a weapon of resistance. What if women united in a peaceful strike, refusing relationships and reproduction? Society would come to a grinding halt. No children. No heirs. A collective pause until further notice.",
    des15:
      "But beyond symbolic gestures, women need tangible solutions to reclaim confidence in their own bodies. Their sexuality must become a means of emancipation, not a tool of enslavement.",

Life is not reducible to romance or familial roles. It is deeper, vaster than security or social constructs. It is a tapestry of skills, suffering, and a journey through culture in search of the self—reformulating, again and again, the images within.",

    des1: "As time passes, we observe an increasing hysteria surrounding religion in Arab societies—albeit with varying degrees from one to another, depending largely on differences in social structures and historical heritage. This hysteria, which engulfs both individuals and groups, entraps them within the confines of an oppressive religious authority and transforms them into marionettes manipulated by the clergy.",
    des2: "It is precisely for this reason that I believe we are entitled to question the mental health of these self-proclaimed ‘spiritual leaders’, as well as their legitimacy to assume the role of moral guides to individuals and society—especially given the unprecedented proliferation of global religious channels, financed either by official bodies or covertly supported by state institutions.",
    des3: "Let us then psychoanalyse these so-called thought leaders who exert a powerful and direct influence on individuals in societies where, unfortunately, such a role is monopolised by religious figures. The overwhelming volume of fatwas—most of which obsessively revolve around sexual matters—is worthy of serious consideration.",
    des4: "These rulings are presented as nothing more than the fulfilment of divine will, and as a yearning for a paradise constructed entirely on the premise of sexual excess. It is therefore our right to question this contradictory and obsessive preoccupation with sex, which exposes a neurotic condition widespread across religious societies.",
    des5: "These societies are, on the one hand, deeply committed to frozen moral codes, while simultaneously harbouring a growing obsession with pornography, a diminishing sense of personal productivity, and a general air of dissatisfaction.",
    des6: "Some may attribute this condition solely to economic hardship and oppressive regimes that consume and squander the raw potential of their citizens. However, we must also shed light on the foundations of the oppressive mindset itself.",
    des7: "Tyrannical governments draw their strength and authority from religion, reflecting, with great clarity, the child’s submission to a despotic father figure. The oppressive psyche manifests in three key dimensions: first, the father as absolute master, extended through his sons who enforce his law; second, the Almighty God, represented on earth by religious institutions and embodied by clergymen granted a divine mandate; and finally, the same authority channelled through autocratic governments personified by a ruler at the helm.",
    des8: "From a psychoanalytical perspective, we must seek to unveil the secret behind this sexual obsession so characteristic of the clergy. Clinical studies have long demonstrated the impact of repressed biological instincts on the control of individuals—redirecting sexual energy as a force driving collective interest.",
    des9: "In this process, the individual is neglected, and in exchange, granted a sense of belonging, continuously reinforced with a feeling of security. This sense of security, however, serves only to anchor the individual within a sphere that fortifies the dominant power.",
    des10:
      "Yet the tyrannical mind is ultimately incapable of truly providing security—hence religion’s constant promise of compensating for the lack with an imaginary paradise.",
    des11:
      "Likewise, the notion of a tyrannical family unit led by a domineering father nurtures a culture of self-restraint and suspicion towards the other—particularly those who are different. This self-restraint dovetails with religious notions of sexual repression and the rigid structuring of sexual conduct.",
    des12:
      "Genuine happiness, however, arises from fulfilling basic biological needs and the pursuit of pleasure. This pursuit is crucial to the individual’s psychological maturity, yet this biological imperative is systematically distorted and repressed.",

      "Wilhelm Reich’s clinical research traced sadomasochism, rape, and a host of neurotic behaviours back to cultures of repression and sexual prohibition. These are not natural desires but rather perversions born of distortion—behaviours twisted by the moral codes imposed by prohibitionist mentalities.",
    des14:
      "Real happiness and fulfilment compel individuals towards genuine creativity—something that becomes possible only when the pleasure principle is allowed to unfold under natural, rather than repressive, laws.",
    des15:
      "Because moral codes grounded in repression are inherently incompatible with the pleasure principle, it becomes necessary for individuals to begin by denouncing the sexual and psychological abuse inflicted during childhood and adolescence by the family, and to extend that rebellion to the moral codes imposed by spiritual authorities.",

      "This initial defiance may eventually escalate into broader political dissent, creating the possibility of a new social dynamic.",

      "Let us return, then, to the clergy—and interrogate the disturbing similarities in their behaviours and mental patterns, which appear to be symptoms of a common neurosis.",
    des18:
      "They often exhibit sadistic tendencies towards their wives and masochistic tendencies in their interactions with the state. Their objectives are closely aligned with those of oppressive governments: to enforce total submission of the individual—whether through physical oppression (as is the norm in repressive regimes) or through psychological violence (institutionalised within religious practice).",
    des19:
      "The clergy and their supportive governments have entered into an unspoken marriage of mutual interest, yet remain deeply resentful of one another, awaiting the first opportunity to bring the other down should disagreement arise.",

      "An exploration of perception, ego, and inherited belief systems through the lens of psychology, neuroscience, and cultural critique.",
    des1: "I begin this article with a familiar maxim: One of the earliest teachings imparted to a human being is never to follow any principle blindly or in herd-like fashion, nor to defend any idea or belief without clear personal conviction.",
    des2: "To this, I would add: one must recognise the limits of one’s knowledge—however expansive it may seem—resist the temptation of an all-knowing ego, and abandon the stubbornness that comes from clinging to perspectives shaped solely by individual experience or immediate surroundings. Only then can we broaden our understanding, soar into vast intellectual spaces, and consciously savour the boundless freedom of creative thought.",
    des3: "In response to a series of messages accusing me of “Freudianism”, I dedicate this article to acknowledging the contributions of several scholars in psychology, neuroscience, and anthropology—fields I have drawn upon extensively in my work.",
    des4: "While it is true that many of Freud’s ideas have become foundational to various schools of psychology, those very schools have also challenged several of his assumptions, often accusing him of becoming entangled in overly elaborate theories. The concept of libido, for instance, is no longer confined to Freud’s framework; it has become a key element in numerous psychological models. A closer look at contemporary neurological research reveals both convergence with and divergence from Freudian thought.",
    des5: "I intend to explore these intersections and contradictions in a more expansive future essay. For now, the limited space of this piece compels me to focus on a more specific concern: the act of perceiving the Other—not through reflexive rejection or ego-centric interpretation, but through an openness that transcends inherited certainties.",
    des6: "What puzzled me most about the aforementioned messages was not simply their rejection of the psychological and anthropological foundations underpinning my arguments, but their reduction of these perspectives to a simplistic Freudian label. This, despite my meticulous citation of relevant scholars for each concept I referenced—precisely to avoid such misreadings and to shield the discussion from ideological dismissal.",
    des7: "This prompted a moment of self-questioning. Was the failure to communicate mine? But the arrival of other, more perceptive responses—messages marked by intellectual depth and a willingness to transcend the confines of the ego—allowed me to shift my focus from self-doubt to the deeper question of where the misunderstanding truly lies. I rarely encounter such resistance when engaging with individuals from non-Arab cultures.",
    des8: "Let us consider, then, the mechanisms of perception. These begin with an ego structured by mental images embedded in the brain, which are in turn processed through sensation, shaped by the external environment, collective context, and imagination. From this interplay emerges the individual self.",
    des9: "In Arab societies, the perceptual framework is often shaped by fixed religious tenets absorbed from early childhood. These ingrained structures prevent the individual from connecting with their instincts or plumbing the depths of their own psyche. They enclose the person within a framework of false values that conflict with their psychological makeup.",
    des10:
      "And yet, paradoxically, such structures awaken in the individual a need for distinction—often satisfied through religious pride and identification with sacred symbols. This phenomenon is not limited to religion; it extends to ideologies, nationalisms, and ethnic identities. The result is a readiness to impose fixed labels on language and expression.",
    des11:
      "This tendency towards generalisation induces a partial paralysis in the face of new meanings and concepts. The individual becomes incapable of navigating alternative modes of thought, unable to venture beyond the inherited values lodged in their mental landscape. What often appears as a flat rejection of unfamiliar ideas is, in truth, a symptom of a cognitive foundation that excludes critical inquiry and cultivates rigid attachment to inherited beliefs. The individual thus becomes tethered to their opinions, resistant to novelty, and subordinated to collective norms and divine authority.",
    des12:
      "The neurologist Lionel Naccache offers a compelling account of how we recognise others—not as a straightforward reception of information, but as a complex internal process. He argues that recognition involves an active preparatory stage that includes imagination and individual interpretation. In other words, the act of recognising another is mediated through a network of personal beliefs that constitute the ego.",
    des13:
      "Thus, the “programmed” individual—incapable of reconfiguring their inner framework—projects meaning onto language in accordance with their own conceptual schemes. This leads to overgeneralisation, dissolving nuance and obscuring any attempt to break free from the confines of familiar categories.",
    des14:
      "There is no denying that dismantling the belief systems upon which one has built an entire life is no easy task. Nor is it easy to dislodge an ego modelled on an omniscient, god-like figure. Such individuals instinctively reject any idea they have not previously encountered. When we examine the human psyche, we find it grounded, first, in biological structures, and second, in the cultural context in which it develops.",
    des15:
      "It would be difficult to explain the full process of perception here, particularly as I am relying on recent neurological findings and psychological hypotheses. For this reason, I have dedicated an extended section of my forthcoming book to exploring these themes in depth.",
    des16:
      "Returning to the matter of knowledge and the specific difficulties encountered among some Arabic-speaking readers: many insist on the accuracy of their interpretations, applying personal dictionaries to unfamiliar expressions without any effort to engage with the ideas presented.",
    des17:
      "In my current, provisional view—subject to revision—I believe the core of the problem lies in early childhood education. It is grounded in what are perceived as “absolute truths” handed down through religious teaching—truths presented as beyond questioning or doubt.",
    des18:
      "This is, I believe, the root of the intellectual crisis in Arab societies: rigid foundations that encourage individuals to cling to narrow understandings of knowledge, understandings shaped and surveilled by religious institutions, governmental powers, and even the self.",
    des19:
      "If we look at the process of perception—of becoming aware of ideas—through a neurological lens, we find that it depends on the individual’s capacity and continuous willingness to question all beliefs, foundations, and aspects of the self. It is a constant exercise in dismantling the illusion of truth, a readiness to embrace “non-truths” in the hope of extracting from them fragments of reality.",

      "A critical exploration of how pleasure and biological drives are repressed through religious and cultural domination, with psychoanalytic insights from Reich and Ferenczi.",
    des1: "This is a follow-up to the previous article, as I felt it warranted further clarification. I wanted to begin with the expression “a struggle for existence”, a phrase employed in various ways and often taking on aggressive overtones that inflame a confrontational stance towards the other. At face value, it appears to be a legitimate argument for self-preservation. Increasingly, this attitude has become central to the way groups and individuals interact with those outside their sphere. At this point, we must ask ourselves about the affinities between the principle of the struggle for existence and the principle of domination.",
    des2: "Let us begin by briefly examining our biological system to determine its primary aims. The continuation and prevalence of this system rests on the principle of responding to and fulfilling basic biological needs—such as food, water, and sex. Undoubtedly, these necessities are at the core of our survival. However, at a later stage, they grow more selective and sophisticated in their pursuit of heightened sensations that go beyond mere sustenance, seeking instead an elevated pleasure. This stage, however, presupposes a developed level of consciousness as expressed by individuals.",
    des3: "For this reason, we can assert that the struggle for survival is, at its core, the satisfaction of basic needs in order to attain the highest levels of pleasure and enjoyment. Yet the principle of domination has managed to distort this process, transforming pleasure into an ongoing battle between groups and individuals. Even more profoundly, it has ignited an inner conflict between the individual self and the prevailing values of the external environment. The individual becomes lost in the labyrinth of religions and moral codes. At first, one subjects their own instincts to the most advanced forms of internal torture, eventually extending this self-censure to others. Nowhere is this more evident than in the manifold restrictions placed on sexual drives, which in turn become generalised into a wider repression of the very notion of pleasure. According to Wilhelm Reich, the sexual drive does not seek pleasure—it is its very engine.",
    des4: "Ferenczi observed that the diminishing satisfaction of certain sexual drives arises under a range of pressures exerted by cultural norms, prompting individuals to forsake pleasure in the name of self-preservation—here understood as the conservation of sexual energy. Let us not forget, to use Reich’s own words, that orgasm during intercourse is about the eruption of a hidden biological energy, free of moral restraint or inhibition. Orgasm represents a complete release of the internal contents stirred by sexual arousal. This is why Reich believed that a harmonious relationship with one’s partner allows both parties to reach pleasure. The ego should not be in a conflictual relationship with reality, nor should it limit itself to external constraints at the expense of sexual drives. Male ejaculation or the experience of partial pleasure in female sexuality—when disconnected from their corresponding sexual drives due to prolonged arousal—does not guarantee the release of sexual energy. Without such release, they will not attain the point of orgasmic satisfaction, which is vital to a psychologically and physiologically healthy existence.",
    des5: "Let us return to the influence of religion on sexual energy, particularly in how religions attempt to organise and structure this energy within the collective unconscious of individuals. Such interference hinders psychological maturation and prevents individuals from gaining responsible sexual experience, which would otherwise allow them to seek pleasure in a fulfilling manner. Only then can individuals regulate their sexual relations in responsible and autonomous ways. Cultures built upon the model of a god ruling over slaves can only mirror the image of that god. Through their moral codes, they perpetuate the representation of a powerless being, entirely alien to pleasure and enjoyment.",
    des6: "Let me return now to the consequences of repressing individuals. This repression often drives them into delusions and fantasies as a means of compensating for unrealised pleasure. Certain schools of psychoanalysis hold that such acts of repression regress individuals to an infantile stage, marked by the most primitive mental features of human infancy. Sexuality, as interpreted by men raised in a macho cultural framework—which prevails across numerous societies whose laws are rooted in religious teachings—is almost always anchored in the image of invasion and penetration of the female body. This image, in turn, is underpinned by an unconscious rapist mentality. From a psychoanalytic perspective, it reflects the male’s desire to compensate for a sense of deficient masculinity, resulting from a psychological regression to early childhood. This regression rekindles the desire to overcome the trauma of castration and the deep-seated sense of inadequacy that stems from paternal prohibition. The repression of sexual energies often finds misguided outlets in perverse practices and accounts for the resurgence of infantile fantasies and irrational mental constructs.",
    des7: "Let us now revisit the principle of domination. As outlined above, it does not align with the struggle for existence, for the biological system is sustained only when its essential needs are met. Domination, by contrast, serves merely to substitute individual pleasure with an energy redirected to serve group interest, often at the expense of the individual.",
    des8: "Delgado established a link between aggression and the pain experienced by subjected individuals, functioning through a system of rewards and promotions. Religions operate according to the same logic of punishment and reward. They promise a heaven that tantalises the fantasies of the faithful—offering in the afterlife what was denied to them in this world. This abstract and illusory pleasure derails individual fulfilment from its natural course and blocks the imperative of releasing sexual energy as a path towards enjoyment. It substitutes real pleasure with an intangible one, thereby causing biological disturbances in the proper functioning of the sexual organs.",
    des9: "In conclusion, I can only add that the notion of a god who controls instincts and drives is fundamentally at odds with our pursuit of awareness—a level of awareness that enables us to engage in sexual relations based on mutual desire, to attain intense orgasms and foster a healthy biological system. This can only be achieved when our instincts are in agreement with our convictions. A religious person practising abstinence and self-restraint knows nothing of enjoyment, for they are perpetually under the unconscious impression that they are committing a sinful act—one forbidden by the gods.",
    des10:
      "The goal is not to encourage unrestrained sexual activity, but rather to arrive at a point where our thoughts and instincts are reconciled. It is only then that we can push thought forward and escape the maze of sterile and relentless arousal. Perhaps, one day, we may attain the most advanced level of harmony with nature—allowing us to reach out to everything around us, to sail within its vastness, to overcome our lingering fears, and to journey towards the no-place, the a-temporal, the no-thing, where our fragmented selves converge into a state of absolute freedom.",

      "This article analyzes the psychological underpinnings of verbal aggression, especially among religious individuals, exploring the link between repressed sexual energy and hostile language.",
    des1: "Following the debate broadcast on France 24 — “The Burka Ban Debate in France” (08/07/2010) — I received a deluge of hostile emails laced with aggressive insults and loaded innuendos. This prompted me to devote an analytic article to the phenomenon of insults and verbal aggression, particularly as exhibited by religious individuals, in an effort to understand their apparent inability to resort to a more elevated form of language. My aim is to explore the reasons that confine them within a narrow and enclosed cognitive frame.",
    des2: "Let us begin by examining the type of verbal aggression saturated with sexual imagery. These insults betray repressed sexual desires in search of release. The religious individual is perpetually engaged in unconscious acts of sublimation, burying these unacknowledged desires deep within. This mechanism of self-defence and repression is further reinforced and obscured by the accumulation of negative residues within their immediate social and cultural environment.",
    des3: "I wish to focus briefly on the words “happiness” and “joy”, which are often misinterpreted as synonyms of “pleasure”. In many societies today, the term “pleasure” is denigrated, resented, and used interchangeably with the other two, despite important distinctions between them. These nuances are too often neglected. The believer’s naïve intellect fails to recognise that it is subject to a culture that solidifies its authority through abstract “truths” embedded in procedural or implicit memory. The interplay between short- and long-term memory unconsciously shapes our behaviour and habits, at times allowing information to surface in consciousness in a distorted form.",
    des4: "If we delve deeper into the psychological states hidden beneath such terms, we find that “happiness” represents the dominance of concepts acquired from one’s environment. When this is paired with the misperceptions that stem from intellectual complacency, the result is a state of joy or cheerfulness. “Pleasure”, however, complements these states. Sexual intercourse, in this context, acts as a channel to process the energy arising from these emotional states and affects — which, as we know, are located in and closely linked to the sexual organs.",
    des5: "Returning to insults steeped in sexual imagery, we find they are nothing more than projections of the religious person’s internal fantasies and frustrations — a psychological outlet for the inner images produced by various mechanisms of repression and often entangled with one another. Thus, the religious person hurls insults referencing sexual positions or group sex; at times, they unconsciously reveal more primitive desires, such as intercourse with the mother, which they project onto the Other — the different. In truth, they are expressing transgressive fantasies, forbidden desires, and perhaps even deeply buried ancestral memories encoded in our genetic structure.",
    des6: "This psychological condition is frequently found in individuals raised in repressive societies that hold them in a state of perpetual subjugation. By contrast, an individual who is aware of their biological specificities and external environment defines, in a conscious and responsible manner, a set of principles, values, and ethics that honour every living being, and strives to uphold these standards in interactions with all creatures — human and non-human alike.",
    des7: "The problem with those who are mentally programmed, operating in a mechanical manner, and cut off from basic civic values is that they cannot reconcile with themselves, let alone others. They exist in a constant state of denial about their instinctual drives and display overt intolerance towards the Other. Their cultural environment has annulled desire and reduced sexuality to a mechanical reproductive function.",
    des8: "This disjunction between instinctual drives and biological needs on one side, and external cultural constructs on the other, leads to schizophrenic behaviour and a range of other psychological disturbances, including deep-seated anxiety.",
    des9: "Neurobiologist Henri Laborit explains that language is the primary mechanism by which domination is established, as it assumes an institutional form tied to the group rather than the individual. In this framework, sexual satisfaction is sublimated and replaced by the gratification derived from domination. It is thus unsurprising that individuals living in taboo-ridden societies relinquish much of their sexual rights in favour of, first, individual, and then collective domination. Ironically, these same oppressed individuals become staunch defenders of the moral codes that suppress their own instinctual needs. All of this functions within the same structure of ego-based domination, where the ego serves the collective interest at the expense of the individual — who is, in return, compensated with trivial and simplistic satisfactions.",
    des10:
      "Let us return to repressed biological satisfaction — namely, sex — and its relation to anxiety and hostile (verbal) behaviour.",
    des11:
      "Each individual’s sensory activity seeks structural satisfaction, also known as biological balance, which involves the pursuit of happiness, joy, and pleasure simultaneously. However, when these biological drives encounter external laws rooted in domination, anxiety ensues. This anxiety emerges from the realisation that pleasure, and hence instinctual fulfilment, is unattainable. In an attempt to escape this condition, the individual becomes hostile and aggressive towards any stimulus that threatens to expose or awaken those repressed instincts. Aggressive behaviour thus becomes a mechanism for mitigating the psychological anxiety triggered by internal conflict and neurological tension distributed across various levels of the biological system. A repressed individual struggles even to recognise, let alone fulfil, these latent and inhibited drives.",
    des12:
      "It is in this light that one can understand the tendency of religious individuals to resort — often unconsciously — to verbal aggression laced with sexual imagery. This is perhaps the most commonplace and least severe form of aggression they exhibit. Such language serves as an outlet for their repressed sexual energy and unfulfilled fantasies. What we are dealing with here are clearly neurotic subjects.",
    des13:
      "We must also acknowledge the inner struggle between acquired values and instinctual drives, the latter being inscribed in our procedural memory. Acts of sublimation only widen the divide between consciousness and the unconscious, resulting in a split between implicit and explicit memory.",
    des14:
      "For this reason, it seems vital to return to the principle of pleasure — not to indulge it uncritically, but to reconcile it with the values we inherit from our surroundings, thereby shaping new ethical paradigms. These must acknowledge our instincts, respect the integrity of the individual, and harmonise, rather than clash, with collective interest.",

      "Exploring the psychological roots of religious belief and myth through the lens of childhood development and instinctual repression.",
    des1: "The fantasies which overwhelm our rational thinking are, in their essence, the fruits of a mental image that compensates for disappointments or psychological anxiety. When freed from restrictions and external taboos, these fantasies are given free rein, evolving into imaginary fictions that gradually develop and solidify into influential narratives with far-reaching implications for our lives and ways of thinking. They give birth to all kinds of monsters, gods, and demons.",
    des2: "But where does this imaginary mental image come from?",
    des3: "Psychological anthropology has revealed to us the source of these stories, which are primarily rooted in childhood. The child’s reliance on the external world inspires a feeling of instability and cautiousness, which in turn breeds anxiety and psychological aggression towards the other. This plays a dominant role. Such feelings manifest themselves more clearly in dreams or during therapeutic sessions undergone by patients suffering from mental illness. But without doubt, they are even more visible in myths, legends, gods, and religions.",
    des4: "Let us return to the condition of infancy—out of which these fictional images grew and developed over time into mythological religions. Of course, we must examine them from a rational perspective—that is, beyond the sentimental realm inherited through rote learning and prolonged brainwashing.",
    des5: "Certainly, we cannot attribute the emergence of religions and gods to a single factor. No one reason alone explains the phenomenon. Rather, a variety of influential elements interact—manifesting differently among individuals and groups. More precisely, individual psychological factors operate in interplay with genetic, environmental, and collective influences. Religions are a psychological sum that began with the natural catastrophes endured by all living species, continuing through the emergence of the first humans and their gradual biological evolution.",
    des6: "Many will reject this thesis—that suffering has been internalised within the human collective unconscious—as implausible or irrelevant. Science has yet to provide an irrefutable mechanism to explain how this internalisation and transmission occurred. Yes, we have competing theories, some of which cancel each other out. However, I am dumbfounded by individuals and institutions that dismiss reason and scientific thinking outright, and yet do not hesitate to exploit the gaps in scientific knowledge. They cling to whatever fragment supports their religious doctrines—while ignoring everything else.",
    des7: "I can understand one scientific theory being used to criticise or refute another on the basis of insufficient evidence. What I cannot understand is when individuals and groups, who live and breathe fables, who fear God and Satan, who are convinced of divine unknowns and predestination, suddenly invoke scientific evidence—evidence they neither understand nor respect—solely to challenge theories that contradict their beliefs and to validate the accuracy of their myths.",
    des8: "Such people can only be described as photocopying machines of rote information. More than that, their behaviour, ideas, and moral codes betray an impotence to acknowledge the primary importance of the sexual instinct. And it is this particular aspect—so often neglected by believers in their selective and cunning appeals to science—that I wish to emphasise.",
    des9: "These people can see and interpret only through the lens of what has been forbidden by an emasculated god. To compensate for this divine impotency, they impose a masculine ascendancy founded upon the marginalisation—and eventual erasure—of femininity.",
    des10:
      "Let us delve into the fundamentals of gods and demons, and explore the duality of good and evil. These dualities, I argue, are all derived from the sexual instinct. This is why the prohibition and distortion of instincts and drives are necessary for fables to exert control over the human mind. To achieve a balanced and healthy cognitive state, we must understand the cognitive origins of myths—and reconcile ourselves with our instincts.",
    des11:
      "Let us journey through the meanderings of myth, as found among Aboriginal Indian tribes, and consider stories recorded by anthropological studies of the ancient inhabitants of the Andaman Islands, in order to extract their hidden meanings. According to Roheim, the Andaman myth is centred on the figure of the primitive All-Father, Puluga. As in Freud’s account of the father of the primal horde, Puluga monopolised all the women of the tribe to satisfy his sexual needs. Over time, the men (the sons) rose up and killed Puluga, replacing the original paternal tyranny with new laws governing sexual relations. The theme of patricide runs through many myths. It was on this pattern that Freud formulated his thesis regarding the origins of morality, tied to the guilt complex.",
    des12:
      "Every sexual relationship is founded on this archetypal act of guilty reconciliation with the murdered father. Paradoxically, it is this act that reaffirms paternal authority through the prohibition of incest—first between mother and son, then between siblings.",
    des13:
      "Let us take a closer look at these myths, which suggest that the son’s sexual desire for his mother may have been reciprocated. The mystery of the mother’s pregnancy—without direct intercourse with her son—appears frequently in totemic, Greek, and other mythologies.",
    des14:
      "We must grasp the nature of this unique bond between mother and son. This was the first taboo, established even before the prohibition of incest between siblings, or between father and daughter. One might argue that the father’s ignorance of his own role in procreation contributed to the delayed emergence of these latter taboos.",
    des15:
      "Analytical studies of neuroses in the field of psychological anthropology show that the first masculine anxiety stems from the castration complex—not before, but during intercourse. The fear of the female sexual organ (experienced during the act) becomes confused with the fear of castration (which should precede it). These are two distinct anxieties, but they collapse into a single moment and are experienced anachronistically. Likewise, the child’s longing to return to the maternal womb reflects a paradox—simultaneous sexual desire and fear.",
    des16:
      "In the myth of Biliku (a female spider), the mother figure represents protection from danger. Tarai (a monitor lizard) is both son and husband—subject to her authority, yet complicit with her. (Notably, Biliku and Tarai are also the Andaman names for the two dominant monsoon winds.) The mother-son relationship here reflects mutual sexual desire maintained in a perpetual state of tension. In Freudian terms, this becomes the inner conflict between the superego—associated with religion and morality—and the feminine principle, which represents libido and a return to primal instinct. Perhaps this is why spiritual religions have granted women a privileged yet restricted role, often as objects of sexual temptation.",
    des17:
      "One might say that the marginalisation of the feminine, the reduction of her role to procreation, and the denial of her sexual agency all stem from this ambiguous relationship between mother and son. On one hand, there is the son’s fear of and desire for the mother; on the other, the mother’s control, her protective nature—and her penis envy, expressed through a persistent drive to compensate for lack.",

      "With the previous article, I stopped at the discussion of the idea of the mother–son mutual sexual desire, which results, on the one hand, from the mother’s penis envy and, on the other, from the child’s castration complex, as it is known and explained in psychoanalytic theory.",
    des2: "Each time we look closer at myths, we find that this complex is a constitutive element in the mother–son relationship. It reflects a desire and a mutual compensation mechanism. I argue that God, demons, and morality stem from this complex relationship between the mother and her son.",
    des3: "Perhaps psychoanalysis concentrated more on the relationship of the father to his son, and this is a recurrent theme in many myths. The external world and the social environment are most often perceived from a masculine perspective. And this is something natural, because our perception is born out of the dominant individual ego, and no matter how hard we try to distance ourselves from it, we always fall in its trap with various degrees. This is why I think that we need to look once again in more depth at the myths from a feminine perspective and interpret them in a different fashion. Of course, we need to depart from the previous premises without endorsing them uncritically and unconditionally. We need to try and rebuild the premises and the theories. I personally find that the relationship based on competition and reconciliation between the father and the son is in reality preceded by a close, affectionate relationship based on a repressed mutual sexual desire between the mother and the son.",
    des4: "According to an Andaman myth, the cause of the original sin or crime are two women who crushed plants under the influence of sun heat. Géza Roheim believes that strong sun light in this myth reflects the idea of strong sexual desire expressed by women towards men, or more accurately, towards the phallus. The first transgressive act and the ensuing institution of taboo and prohibition have something to do with the mother. She has effectively practiced sex with her son and she carried on a rebellious act of transgression when the group turned the son into a taboo. The son’s act of rebellion follows from this when the son became a father and gave prominence to sexual desires in order to serve his interests and satisfy his own sexual appetites. This is best revealed in the prohibition of sexual intercourse between mother and son. The primary desire and intense sexual thirst expressed by the mother towards her son precedes the mother-son mutual desire for each other.",
    des5: "So the father- son relation and what ensued from it is in reality the result of an older and stronger relation a much more complex one, the mother- son relation. This relation is best illustrated in another myth found in the same tribe when the first mother annihilated the entire human race to avenge the death of her son the Monitor lizard. The lizard, here, is a phallic symbol because it has this capacity to grow once again its missing organs. This is how the male succeeds in defeating his fear of castration by re-enacting and at the same time denying this very complex.",
    des6: "Many anthropologists agreed that the totem and taboo of plants symbolises the prohibited sexual relation. Each type of plant refers to a sexual act. Morality, prohibitions and religious doctrines are grounded in sexual relation and reproductive organs. In other words we can say that the god who is today worshipped by many people across their religious differences is the outcome of a complex sexual relation which is very confusing, that has been subjected to the contradictions of the individual’s psychic condition and then extended to the group. God is then the outcome of an old taboo, the forbidden mother son relation There is enough ground in the totemic myths to identify the original mother who has made many plants forbidden for the members of the tribe and reserved the exclusive right of their consumption to herself. As we said earlier, each plant symbolises a sexual act.",
    des7: "But we need to ask ourselves how this feminine sexual freedom has been displaced from the female or the original mother to the male. In other words, we need to ponder over the reversal of the leadership role of the two sexes as identified in these aboriginal myths.",
    des8: "I personally believe that this displacement happened via the son who capitalised on the mother’s weak instincts towards him to thwart her tyranny. He thus created moral laws and other restraints to curb the (maternal) feminine libido. He was compelled to take upon himself the role of the super-ego or the moral law. It is for this reason that one can detect traces of the sons’ sexual desire towards their mothers and their fear of castration if this desire is expressed openly. That is to say, the son who one day will play the role of the father preferred the repression of his sexual desire towards the mother (who represents woman in general) for the benefit of the father, that is to say for his own interest in the future. We can say this differently, that man preferred future interests to immediate ones and since the mother is a future condition of the woman (daughter) she, too, preferred the far removed interest to the one that is closer to her and she started helping her son to exercise his control and to remove power from her hands to his.",
    des9: "We must understand that this process—whereby authority is delegated to the son qua the foundation of the masculine embodiment of law and morality—did not occur without turmoil, but followed numerous psychological struggles experienced by both the mother and the son. In order to soothe this masculine condition, constructed around future interests for both the mother (projected in a digressive manner through the image of the daughter who may in turn become a mother) and the son (projected in a progressive manner through the image of the son who may become a father), it became necessary to uphold a relationship rooted in future interest. This was achieved through repressive religious concepts designed to suppress any rebellious attempt to challenge the laws of taboo and prohibition. It is for this reason that we find god himself suffering from many contradictions which reflect the primitive condition of the primary sexual relation between mother and son. Similarly, we find women, especially the ones subjected to these laws and to religious practices, entertaining a cherished dream to give birth to a male child in order to recover her lost privileges and return to her position of authority.",
    des10:
      "It is therefore no surprise that many Aboriginal tribes and certain religions prohibited polygamy. Monogamous societies reflect the privileged position of the son’s relationship with his mother and his desire to return to a state of infancy by attaching himself to one woman—that is, aspiring to a second childhood. This behaviour is also observed in some species of monogamous monkeys.",
    des11:
      "Let us return to tribal societies that subscribe to monogamy. In these, we find practices grounded in the mother–son–father triangle and in the sanctification of marriage upon the birth of a child. This is particularly evident in Christianity, where the mother is symbolically replaced by the Holy Spirit. Such a shift reflects a digression in the authority of the woman—especially the mother—within these societies at the time. And, of course, the condition of women in these societies has not improved, due to the weight of inherited historical, cultural, and religious values.",
    des12:
      "So God represents an act of sublimation of a masculinity built on the complex of guilt born out of a forbidden sexual relation between mother and son, while the invention of demons and monsters reflects the original condition of the child’s pure sexual drives according to the analysis of experts in psychological anthropology. This in turn has been proved by many psychoanalysts through various clinical analyses carried out on different children, best summed up in the child’s desire to penetrate the mother’s body which also results in psychological anxiety. This condition which affects the child pushes him to seek refuge in imagination and fantasies which invent stories of goblins, demons and monsters.",

      "An exploration into how childhood experiences shape our perception of divinity and inner conflict through anthropological, psychological, and neurological lenses.",
    des1: "Neuroscience and psychology have revealed much about the internal struggles of the human mind—particularly the tension between the rational clarity that governs us during the day and the illusions and imaginings that overtake us at night. These nightly visions transport us to the mazes of childhood, to distant memories accumulated over time, memories that shift in form, merge with others, and create entirely new mental images.",
    des2: "Let us explore the origins of gods, religions, and myths—phenomena shaped by cumulative human experience, rooted especially in early childhood, according to various anthropological, psychological, and neurological studies. If we examine the relationship between humans and gods, it becomes apparent that it mirrors, in essence, the parent-child dynamic. Yet it is childhood anxiety that pushes this relationship into another realm, granting it broader reach and emotional force. This evolution did not unfold in a direct, conscious manner, but rather through a shared linguistic framework—one that fused divine traits with lofty and benevolent words. Likewise, the system of reward and punishment between parents and children was mirrored in the divine-human relationship, forming the foundation of many religious doctrines.",
    des3: "The neurologist Michael Persinger shed light on this link, arguing that the child’s need for basic biological necessities—food, warmth, affection—met by parents, becomes projected onto the divine. Hence, we often find that meals are accompanied by expressions of gratitude to God. This also explains why many missionary religious organisations distribute food and drink; the divine becomes closely associated with satisfying primal human needs.",
    des4: "A child clings to their mother because she provides nourishment, safety, and comfort. Yet, as time passes, the sense of guaranteed protection wanes—parents, after all, do not live forever. Here begins a psychological compensation for the loss of childhood security, driven by the child’s inability to take responsibility or defend themselves. Thus, the parental figure is gradually replaced by an omnipotent force—a mighty, boundless god. This helps us understand the presence of feminine deities in early cultures, particularly in matriarchal societies, and how their gender shifted over time with the transition to patriarchal structures.",
    des5: "After extensive fieldwork among Australian tribes, the anthropologist and psychologist Geza Roheim confirmed the role of childhood in the invention of myths and deities. He built upon insights from paediatrician and psychoanalyst Donald Winnicott, who found that the mother’s image evolves in the psyche of the child—from a gentle, nurturing figure to that of a witch or monster—resulting from her inability to meet all the child’s needs. This transformation appears in countless myths of female demons or flesh-eating spirits who punish men—such as the fearsome figure of Kanarintia, who visits men at night, sits on their genitals, and subjects them to judgement and punishment, sometimes mutilating or even killing them with her poisonous sexual organ. These primitive embodiments of divine punishment and mythology find their roots in the mother-child relationship.",
    des6: "Among the Pitjantjatjara tribe in Australia, for example, women are affectionate and tender with their children, yet are said to consume the weaker among them, offering greater care to the stronger ones. This form of selection mirrors patterns in the animal world and resonates with the theory of natural selection.",
    des7: "Such practices also spark in children a buried urge for revenge. Some specialists suggest that demons and spirits symbolise the child’s repressed desire to penetrate and devour the mother’s body. As the psychoanalyst Melanie Klein explained, “The child projects their aggression first onto the mother, then the father, becoming immersed in fantasies of bodily destruction.”",
    des8: "It is likely that the very bond between mother and child—from conception in the womb to the trauma of birth—played a central role in producing childhood anxiety, which later fed into mythological and, eventually, religious storytelling.",
    des9: "This anxiety cannot be resolved peacefully. It is filtered through conflicting emotions and an overwhelming sense of guilt. The psyche thus splits into binary oppositions—good and evil, heaven and hell, God and the Devil. One cannot exist without the other. All humans grapple with these internal contradictions, yet a conscious will can guide us towards deeper understanding and more thoughtful choices.",
    des10:
      "By contrast, the person who surrenders unquestioningly to their god and religion—without reflection, without scrutiny—resembles a child oblivious to the world around them, surrendered to parental protection. That same state of submission and comfort is later transferred to a divine figure, relieving the believer of the burden of thought and responsibility.",
    des11:
      "We notice, then, that associating divinity with certain grandiose terms does little to help individuals distinguish between illusion and experience. It impedes the pursuit of a more profound understanding—one that transcends demons, sorcerers, and deities altogether. These exalted terms form a linguistic barrier that obstructs our conscious will to examine history and its ailments, and to craft new frameworks that address our biological and psychological needs, without necessarily clashing with collective values.",
    des12:
      "Thus, control over individuals is often exercised through linguistic pathways embedded in memory, becoming automatic responses devoid of empirical grounding. If one asks, “Who is God?”, the answer often arrives instantly—yet it is usually empty of analysis. God has become the ready answer for anyone who cannot, or will not, engage their mind.",

    des1: "Most often, we make sense of ideas in relation to how much they correspond with our own private notions. Take, for instance, the moment we encounter a face and attempt to assess its relevance to us: a complex neurological operation unfolds, wherein some regions of the brain identify the person while others retrieve associated memories or relational links. This cooperation between different neural functions informs the conscious stream of recognition and response.",
    des2: "We could say, then, that our perception and assimilation of external data—particularly that conveyed by others—are caught in a continuous dynamic of either collision or agreement. If we examine more closely how individual egos respond to texts, words, and expressions, we find their reactions rooted in biology. These responses are directly tied to personal experiences stored in long-term memory, which naturally differ from one person to another.",
    des3: "Our understanding, then, and the way we process or respond to stimuli, is filtered through the complex structure of the ego—an ego that contains within it a measure of imagination. We can never truly claim objectivity, but we can choose to engage with unfamiliar ideas—those lying outside the usual framework of our individual perception—by refining the ego in the pursuit of knowledge and discovery.",
    des4: "Ego structures differ widely according to cultural and social backgrounds. Anthropologists refer to this as the “cultural model.” It has been observed that individuals who confront texts alien to their own culture often struggle to comprehend them. As a result, they tend to reconstruct these texts, attributing to them meanings more in line with their own cultural understanding—meanings which often diverge significantly from the original intent. In some cases, the foreign or unfamiliar is flatly rejected. In this context, British psychologist Frederic Bartlett proposed the notion of cognitive schemata, shaped by both instinctual drives and later developments such as ideals, moral codes, and the collective or individual interests embedded in various societies.",
    des5: "I begin with this premise in order to explore some of the mechanisms behind our individual responses to ideas that differ from our own. My aim is to examine the phenomenon of the failure to truly listen to, or comprehend, what another person is trying to express.",
    des6: "Personally, I am convinced that this difficulty is intimately linked to the condition of the ego. We must learn to relinquish, even partially, that insistent ego always seeking to assert itself. We must come to see that an ego different from our own does not negate our individuality—rather, it may complete it. Only then might we begin to fill the vast empty spaces between us, to broaden our perception and find an affinity with the ego of the other. And from that place of connection, we could extend our attunement to all living beings—and even to nature itself. Perhaps only then can we reconcile ourselves with the death instinct, embrace freedom, and return to inanimate matter—where rest is absolute, unconsciousness complete, and existential strife dissolved.",
    des7: "It follows, then, that we ought to strive not to overcome death per se, but rather to live and die without suffering. Our fear of death is ultimately a fear of pain and obliteration. This is why I support any attempt that seeks to dismantle the mechanisms of tyranny and break free from the vicious circle of struggle fostered by the ego—attempts that ultimately lead us back to the principle of freedom itself.",
    des8: "Perhaps my words will be interpreted in ways far removed from what I intended. But I accept that. I believe in the legitimacy of all individual attempts at understanding—so long as one does not fall into the trap of self-righteousness. We are all breathing through this self; all of us are striving to affirm the ego, to improve our existence, to overcome the structures that suppress the other. This is the collision between the reality principle and our instincts—the postponement of the pleasure principle in favour of civilised acts of sublimation.",
    des9: "Yet we must ask: are not all forms of sublimation simply redirected flows into the receptacle of the ego—reinforcing it and misleading it, historically and instinctually? In other words, I believe that transcendence and sublimation, when lacking awareness of external realities, only intensify the ego’s imprisonment within rigid visions and beliefs. Were not myths, religions, and ideologies forms of unconscious collective and individual sublimation—so powerful that they turned us into a flock unable to grasp the depth of experiences concealed behind mere words?",
    des10:
      "Looking more closely, we observe that those who are enclosed within their own cultural constructs—and here I use “culture” in its broadest sense—struggle to engage with unfamiliar ideas. They are often swayed by alluring words that they neither feel nor understand. This discrepancy between their actions and their speech reveals itself in glaring contradictions.",
    des11:
      "Yes, we are all susceptible to falling into the trap of the ego—the ego that believes it already knows everything. But through the accumulation of consciousness and sincere attempts to engage with thought, we can restrain it, relativise it. In doing so, we open the way towards wider horizons, where we can truly encounter the other. When we pass through the walls that separate egos, we begin to connect with other selves, reaching a deeper and more expansive mode of understanding.",
    des12:
      "What we need today is to excavate both individual and collective experiences, and to reconcile the reality principle with the instinctual and the pleasurable. This reconciliation is only possible through a journey into the past—and through the realisation that there is a fragment of truth in every proposition, in every human experience. What we seek is complementarity, not cancellation.",
    des13:
      "Before I conclude, I would like to draw attention to a particular point: the inflation of the ego is a universal human trait, but it is especially noticeable in our Arab societies. Consider the common tendency to mock the other and belittle their serious efforts at expressing their individual self. Would it not be more admirable to refrain from such judgements? It is easy to espouse tolerance in speech, but far more honourable to embody it in action.",
    des14:
      "It is all too easy to fall into the ego's trap—to rush into rejecting ideas that do not conform to what we deem true or correct. But we must resist this impulse, and persuade ourselves that knowledge is attainable only by expanding our perception—by consciously choosing to think beyond our narrow personal desires and interests.",

      "An exploration of the psychological roots of the castration complex, examining how sexual intercourse may symbolically represent a return to the womb and a resolution of the trauma of birth.",
    des1: "In a previous article, “The Sex and Death Syndrome”, I explored the underlying fear within the male psyche of losing his genital organ. In this piece, I turn to examine the psychological roots of that fear, commonly known in psychoanalysis as the castration complex.",
    des2: "Otto Rank proposed that the origin of this complex lies not merely in the threat of genital loss but in the foundational trauma of birth—specifically, the moment of separation from the mother. This interpretation draws upon ontogenesis, the study of an organism’s development from conception onwards. Building on this notion, Ferenczi theorised that the act of sexual intercourse, from an ontogenetic perspective, is an unconscious attempt to release the psychic tension associated with birth and to recapture the emotional warmth and completeness of prenatal existence.",
    des3: "The concept of alloplastic adaptation, as formulated by Freud, Ferenczi, and Alexander Franz, rests on the idea that the organism adapts to external pressures in one of two ways:\n• Through internal transformations in response to its environment, a process known as autoplastic adaptation;\n• Or by actively reshaping the external world to better suit its needs, which constitutes alloplastic adaptation.",
    des4: "Returning to the notion of re-entering the womb, we observe this desire manifesting symbolically in the sexual act across species. For example, copulation among certain spiders can last several hours, while in some parasitic species, the male remains embedded within the female’s body in a state of permanent union.",
    des5: "Following extensive studies of copulation in the animal kingdom, Ferenczi concluded that ejaculation—accompanied by separation from the female body—is a symbolic re-enactment of birth. It is a psychological repetition of the first traumatic rupture that expelled the human being from what he perceives as his original paradise. That paradise, in this view, is none other than the intrauterine state, while the expulsion from it symbolises the moment of birth.",
    des6: "Ferenczi explained how psychic pressure builds up in the body, only to be released through the genital system. This release then radiates outward in a wave of satisfaction, a moment in which the entire organism becomes subservient to the sexual organs. The ego, in this state, merges fully with the executing organ—the penis—during intercourse.",
    des7: "This leads us to Geza Róheim’s interpretation of the soul as a metaphor for sperm. Since the ego momentarily identifies with the penis and its sexual secretions—as Ferenczi posits—and since the act of separating from the sexual partner recalls the trauma of birth and its attendant fear (which, for the male, is symbolised as castration), the male is able to imagine a return to the womb through the female genitalia.",
    des8: "The female, however, cannot imagine such a direct return to the maternal womb and thus seeks to compensate for this inaccessible pleasure through the desire to possess the male organ as a symbolic conduit for that impossible return.",
    des9: "This may explain the male association between semen and the soul—an association absent in the female experience.",
    des10:
      "Scholars have not limited their inquiries to these early ontogenetic factors and the psychological unease they produced. These primal experiences have driven human beings to navigate vast imaginary landscapes expressed through art, religion, and mythology—all of which reflect the deep-seated desire to return to a state preceding birth. This yearning, perhaps, explains the striking convergence of myths across distant cultures and civilisations.",
    des11:
      "From the perspective of phylogenesis—the evolutionary lineage of species—research extends beyond the moment of birth to examine environmental catastrophes that shaped the fate of living beings. One such event, the recession of water levels, compelled some aquatic animals to migrate onto land in order to adapt to their altered environment, in accordance with Lamarck’s theory.",
    des12:
      "Ferenczi suggested that sexual reproduction within the female womb symbolises not merely biological necessity, but a substitution of the aquatic environment with a similar enveloping space—the womb as an echo of water. He even proposed that the struggle between sexes for penetration may have contributed to the development of aggressive masculine traits, particularly following the male’s successful penetration of the female.",
    des13:
      "Palaeontology continues to confirm the radical transformations that living organisms have undergone, just as biology increasingly substantiates many hypotheses first formulated within psychoanalysis. Those who doubt these scientific foundations, citing competing theories, often neglect the interconnectedness of scientific disciplines. Science does not progress through contradiction alone, but through synthesis and overlapping insights.",
    des14:
      "For instance, those sceptical of Lamarck’s environmental adaptation or Darwin’s natural selection would do well to consider the theory of the Irish botanist Hugo de Vries, who argued that biological change occurs not gradually, but through abrupt, discontinuous mutations. These spontaneous leaps give rise to new traits, after which natural selection filters the most suitable adaptations over extended periods.",
    des15:
      "Here, I find a meaningful parallel between de Vries’s conclusions and Ferenczi’s hypothesis. Both attribute the origins of transformation to crisis: in the case of de Vries, to phylogenetic catastrophes that leave lasting traces within the living cell; in Ferenczi’s, to personal traumas that imprint themselves in the genital organs and are released through the act of intercourse.",
    des16:
      "Sex, from this perspective, is far more than a physical act—it is a symbolic endeavour to reverse the foundational expulsion from the womb and to reconnect with the serenity and totality of pre-birth existence. Though such a return is forever barred, the human being remains driven to simulate it—through the body, through the unconscious, and through symbolic rituals of desire, separation, and the eternal longing for origin.",
    des17:
      "Note: The paragraph marked with an asterisk *—which addresses the idea of the female’s desire to possess the male organ as a symbolic substitute for returning to the womb—belongs to a specific tradition within Freudian psychoanalysis. It does not claim to offer a universal interpretation of femininity or gender, but rather reflects a symbolic reading shaped by particular cultural and theoretical contexts of its time.",

    des5: "Neurological science has exposed the mechanisms by which a mental image—acquired and stored in the unconscious—is transferred from the external world to consciousness. This same image may re-emerge, consciously or unconsciously, when triggered by a particular set of circumstances—a web of events and personal experiences linked together.",
    des6: "A close analysis of the imagery in religious texts reveals a recurring pattern of aggression, clothed in stories of violence and punishment. Antiquity teems with scenes of slaughter and sacrifice. Consider, for instance, the tale of Abraham’s willingness to sacrifice his son in obedience to God. This image has been carved deep into the unconscious of Abrahamic believers. And yet, curiously, it evokes no revulsion. No sense of horror is attached to the idea of a father raising a blade to his child—so long as it is done in the name of God. The believer does not see in this act a crime; rather, they perceive divine generosity and a symbol of loyalty. But if we strip away the symbolism—discard the meanings layered upon it over millennia—we are left with the raw image itself: a brutal act, an attempted murder of an innocent, helpless child.",
    des7: "This sort of imagery, which sanctifies the killing of the Other in devotion to God, conditions the faithful to view violence as legitimate. It becomes easier, then, to direct hatred towards anyone who dissents. And thus, it’s no surprise that many self-professed devotees adopt the same Abrahamic logic to punish those who challenge them. This aggression lies buried in the psyche of the believer, ready to erupt whenever external or internal stimuli align. The ideas of violent retribution and divine wrath become normalised. Such a worldview—completely at odds with modern humanistic values—is dangerous on two fronts: collectively, as in the case of Salafi groups; and individually, as illustrated by the tragic case of a carpenter in 1997 who, convinced he heard the voice of God, awoke, entered his infant son’s bedroom, and bludgeoned him to death with a hammer to re-enact the Abrahamic sacrifice.",
    des8: "Neurologist Michael Persinger studied such episodes of aggression linked to deep-seated unconscious imagery. He found that punishment and death—ubiquitous in religious iconography—are etched into the mind of the believer. These images surface as counterfeit divine voices, misinterpreted as commands from the heavens. Persinger explains that religious imagery is constructed from sensory impressions—heard, seen, smelt—and processed in the temporal lobe. When such data are decoded and distributed across the cortex, they quickly harden into belief and are mechanically activated to drive specific behaviours.",
    des9: "These aggressive imprints form part of the individual’s ego. They create a chasm between inner cognition and external reality, impairing the believer’s ability to comprehend anything that does not conform to the unconscious image. This interpretive straitjacket becomes even more perilous when it infiltrates the collective unconscious. At that point, violence and intimidation become the only means of engagement—at the level of the state, the school, and the family. Such collective programming explains the shrinking horizon of thought for individuals and societies that feed on these inherited aggressive images. There is no space for dialogue, no room for deviation. Only a single path is permitted—unchanging, dogmatic, and merciless. This is how tyranny is taught: through a culture of mental colonisation that dominates every aspect of life.",

      "For these reasons, I do not hesitate to lend my voice to the Youth for the Separation between Religion and Education. I endorse their demands wholeheartedly, and I hope others will follow.

      "An exploration of ancient beliefs connecting sexuality, death, and myth, drawing from psychology, anthropology, and cultural symbolism.",
    des1: "Over the years, many psychologists and anthropologists have delved into ancient belief systems, and some have concluded that understanding the human sexual instinct is key to deciphering the myths that gave rise to spirituality and religion. According to this view, the genital region lies at the symbolic heart of many early beliefs.",
    des2: "Geza Roheim posited that sexuality is the unconscious foundation of spirituality—a concentrated essence of the soul. In his interpretation of various myths, he identified a recurring link between semen and the soul. The phallus, in a state of erection or during intercourse, appears to be threatened with detachment from the body—a metaphorical threat of castration. This latent belief, deeply embedded in the unconscious, compelled many researchers to explore tribal myths in search of its origins.",
    des3: "Roheim, for instance, found that in certain societies such as the Māori, sexual climax was viewed as the soul’s dissipation—particularly in the act of ejaculation, where semen, seen as life itself, was expelled from the body. The female genitalia, on the other hand, came to symbolise death. This notion surfaces in the myth of Māui and Hine-nui-te-pō, in which Māui dies upon uniting with the goddess—his death signifying the fatal nature of sexual union. To preserve the soul and avert such danger, these societies developed magical rituals and chants intended to shield the phallus from symbolic death during intercourse.",
    des4: "This brings us to the symbolic role of the earth in such mythologies. Across numerous cultures and languages, the earth is portrayed as feminine and is closely tied to the concept of death. In one legend, the earth tells Rangi: “I shall reclaim you all in death.” The earth, in this sense, represents bodily dissolution—the inevitable return to dust. Ancient cultures often associated the sky with masculinity, as in Greek mythology, where Uranus (the sky) envelops Gaia (the earth goddess). A similar duality appears in Chinese cosmology through the yin and yang.",
    des5: "The beliefs of the Karen people further illustrate this symbolic landscape. According to their mythology, the path to paradise is a spear-shaped bridge between earth and sky, which only a select few men can cross. Those who fail fall back to earth and are transformed into women. In this worldview, women are seen as fallen men—punished through symbolic castration and deprived of the phallus.",
    des6: "The primitive male's fear of losing semen, compounded by his ignorance of reproduction and the female’s role in receiving his seed, gave rise to numerous myths equating ejaculation with death. This may explain the prohibition of sexual intercourse during wartime in some tribes, as it was seen as a harbinger of defeat. In certain Native American tribes, magical practices aimed to retrieve lost semen, reflecting the belief that the male’s spirit resided in it. And since ejaculation implied the woman’s reception of it, the female body—particularly her genitalia—became a locus of death. Hence, in many myths and religious systems, woman is burdened with the symbolic role of evil and suffering.",
    des7: "The fear of castration reappears in many myths, such as that of Osiris and Set, or in primordial tales of sons clashing with their fathers over women. In one version, Osiris castrates his father—a symbolic reenactment of the murder of the “primal father.” Freud, in his interpretation of totemic systems, saw the totem as a displaced father figure whose stature was gradually elevated until it became sacred. The original crime gave rise to a collective guilt, one that reverberates across cultures, myths, and religions.",
    des8: "Death has always haunted the human imagination. Most ancient myths revolve around life after death, or the idea of death as a new birth. The practice of mummification itself seems to have emerged from a belief in another life beyond this one—a promise of eternal happiness to those who believed. This idea reappears across religious systems that promote the notion of everlasting bliss. Yet early humans, unable to reconcile earthly joy with eternal joy—because of conflicting unconscious drives—failed to imagine both simultaneously. Life, being short and uncertain, became something to be compensated for in a mythical afterlife: a realm of perfect, disembodied happiness, untethered from earth and reason.",
    des9: "Looking deeper into early legal and social structures, we find that the totemic belief in living spirits behind natural phenomena was, in essence, an attempt to preserve life. The exchange of souls between humans and their totems—as interpreted by Frazer—and the transmission of vital energy among living beings, contributed to humanity’s invention of the eternal.",
    des10:
      "At the heart of this existential struggle lies the tension between human beings and their doubles—a tension rooted in instinctual desires, especially the need for sexual satisfaction. When these desires go unmet, they can erupt into violence against the other. Freud’s theory of sublimation holds that sexual impulses can be redirected toward social and cultural values, serving the collective good. Still, we must not overlook the fact that sexuality has played a foundational role in shaping the myths and religions that have defined human existence.",

      "An article about the contradiction of freedom claimed by believers who impose their own dogmatic ideologies.",
    des1: "Whilst boasting of their god’s forbearance, “believers” are often the first to cast accusations at those who differ from them. They perpetually whinge and whine, claiming to be victims of moral persecution—especially when they constitute a religious minority in foreign societies which, according to them, are curtailing their freedoms.",
    des2: "Here, one must pause to question the very meaning of freedom—a notion alarmingly absent from their mental lexicon. These “believers” subscribe to nothing beyond monotheistic thought, to the One and Only, to that which must not be questioned, let alone criticised. They go to great lengths to extract from their sacred lexicon powerful terms to reproach the other, bestowing on all who differ from them a series of damning labels.",
    des3: "Ever inventive in their tactics, resourceful in their crusade against those who stray from their gospel, the “believers” employ various forms of assault that may be grouped into three main categories. First comes the assault on expression, executed through orchestrated attacks on websites, blogs, and platforms. This might seem relatively civilised when compared with the next two: verbal assault, often involving a barrage of insults, curses, and threats aimed at silencing dissent; and assault on life, where beheading becomes the ultimate expression of righteous wrath, manifesting an unspeakable degree of cold-blooded violence.",
    des4: "And yet, after committing such acts of brutality, the “believers” come forward to cry foul, complaining of disrespect, claiming their beliefs and personal freedoms have been violated. At this point, it becomes imperative to question the boundaries of personal freedom and assess the positions of all involved in this debate.",
    des5: "Let us begin with religious fundamentalists residing in Western societies. Their demands appear selective, invoking freedom to justify everything from veils to all manner of obscuring attire. Who can say these demands won’t soon extend to praying in the middle of roads, calling for the closure of pubs and bars, banning alcohol, and condemning sexual liberty? Who knows where this spiral of infinite demands—made in the name of personal freedom, religious respect, and wounded sensibilities—might lead?",
    des6: "Time and again, “believers” lecture us on respect and tolerance, all under the banner of personal freedom. And yet they never extend the same courtesy to those who differ from them. For only they possess the truth. Only they are the chosen lovers of Allah. Their god has allegedly granted them the exclusive privilege of divine knowledge. This imagined chosenness becomes their pretext for imposing their will with neither scruple nor restraint, justifying their repression and tyranny as divine mandates.",
    des7: "They are constantly on the hunt, seeking to silence anyone who dares express an opinion, question a belief, or explore an alternative path. At this juncture, we must earnestly consider a new framework for this debate, one that redefines personal freedom and establishes fair, reciprocal boundaries. Both sides—the believers and the other—must be equally bound by the principle of freedom of opinion and expression, without mutual persecution.",
    des8: "Yes, regrettably, the majority of “believers” remain psychologically immature. They perceive every differing opinion as betrayal, and every criticism as an attack. Thus, before clamouring for their own freedoms, moderate believers must clearly and openly condemn the culture of “killing the other and sanctifying his blood.” They must do so without hypocrisy or equivocation, and with a sincere effort to ban religious programming that legitimises such ideology and glorifies this hatred.",
    des9: "We must also interrogate the position of those who defend the rights of religious tyrants to exercise “freedom” based on the annihilation of others—indeed, on the annihilation of freedom itself. There are many who claim not to approve of these crimes, yet rush to shield the perpetrators in the name of tolerance. From where I stand—open as my stance may be to dialogue—I believe we need to take unambiguous, honest positions, free of hypocrisy and untainted by vested interests.",
    des10:
      "Let me return once more to those who cling to belief systems grounded in a singular, unchallengeable truth—beliefs governed by a tyrannical, repressive god, guilty of crimes against humanity, against life, nature, and the cosmos itself. A god who possesses nothing but the sword and the dagger. A god of ignorance, the wellspring of hatred in the souls of his followers.",
    des11:
      "Out of love for life and death, out of reverence for freedom and for nature and all its creatures, let me say: we have no duty—no right—to defend the “freedoms” of those who violate freedom. We must not allow them to weaponise against us the very principles we strive to nurture—principles that aspire to a shared horizon of life and liberty, and to values that transcend local dogmas.",
    des12:
      "This is our battle—a pursuit of a deeper, less biased understanding of the external world, a setting aside of the ego to better encounter the Self, and through it, to touch the essence of other selves. This is the journey of a living being within the heart of nature. A quest for a freedom that surpasses divine decrees. A journey into the very core of the self, stripped bare of pretence.",
    des13:
      "Perhaps I sound radical in my convictions. But I believe freedom comes at a cost. And that cost is the unyielding stance we must adopt against those who would muzzle us and sabotage our progress. These programmed humans, fed with prescribed information, are incapable of thought beyond regurgitated dogma. They operate in herd-like unison, forming a homogenous mass fundamentally at odds with the diversity of nature.",
    des14:
      "We are nature’s multiplicity—they are its parasites. By monotheising truth and virtue, they have surrendered to a mechanical doctrine, closed off to discovery or change.",
    des15:
      "But nature knows no mechanical laws. It is ever-changing, always in flux—as understood in physics, as moving, transmissible energy.",
    des16:
      "It is now urgent that we protect this journey by exposing those who would turn our values against us to destroy both us and the freedoms we cherish. We must strip them of the very liberties they misuse. Let us draw a clear line around a foundational consensus: No freedom must be granted to the slaves of the god of ignorance and ruin.",

      "The quest for something lost and found after many years has long stirred my imagination. It has been a major driving force throughout my life. I was seeking a kind of freedom—one that allows the self to inhabit every being and become one with Mother Nature, much like a child who, without understanding why, longs to return to the sanctuary of the womb.",
    des1: "Perhaps we suffer from a tragic severance between the Self and the Great Nurturer, and we are perpetually striving to comprehend the reason, the wisdom, behind this rupture. It mirrors the trauma of birth—the moment the child is torn from the mother’s body—leaving behind an anxiety that lurks in the unconscious, never fully extinguished.",
    des2: "This is precisely why we must free ourselves from the immutable principles instilled in us in our countries of origin. Human beings are in a state of constant evolution, as are the principles and beliefs we construct for ourselves. Sometimes, we feel compelled to choose life in a country that has—at least to a certain extent—surpassed our own in seeking a balance between individual liberty and collective interest. Such societies have endured centuries of painful struggle to better understand human history and motivation, and to forge a more advanced, more coherent intellectual path.",
    des3: "Here begins the journey of the mind, searching for a guiding thread toward a liberated spirit. This yearning to connect with every living creature is an attempt to align ourselves with the natural order. We must traverse many stages to approach freedom—true freedom—which may only be attainable if every atom of our bodies dissolves once more into the greater natural whole from which we first emerged.",
    des4: "Amid these reflections, the rigid concepts and narrow doctrines of the past are blurred by the seductive effect of the very words we were raised on. Yet there is always a new mode of thinking—one that opens different perspectives, breaks long-held taboos, and shatters the barriers that obstruct human progress. We must ask ourselves: what is the purpose of life, and to what end do we live it? After much painful contemplation, we may come to see that existence is not about clinging to fixed beliefs, but about swaying and dancing gracefully to life’s ever-shifting rhythm.",
    des5: "Never for a moment did I imagine that Europe was a paradise on earth, nor have I ever claimed that Western societies have attained a definitive grasp of noble human ideals. But for individuals in search of depth and clarity of the self, there is an inherent urge to express thoughts and truths in a direct, unflinching manner.",
    des6: "Many of us have repeatedly experienced moments of bitter disappointment, not least due to the blatant hypocrisy and double standards openly expressed in the West, in stark contrast to universal human values. Nevertheless, despite my strong disagreements with how certain issues are addressed, I cannot in good faith dismiss the substantial achievements of Western societies. I feel some contentment regarding the direction my intellectual journey has taken and the small steps I have made in pursuit of free thought. Let us not forget that a society which allows space for expression and critical thought on any matter is, in truth, a society that values its people and sees them as equal before the law.",
    des7: "Of course, such a society must define red lines—boundaries within which individuals can exercise their freedom. Some might question these boundaries, viewing them as a pretext for excluding other cultures. It may appear, at times, that this freedom is granted only to those whose minds and hearts are sufficiently Westernised—that Western culture, like any other, can become a prosecuting machine that casts out all others. Here, I must clarify: humanity must not regress. What the advanced nations of the world uphold today is the product of centuries of struggle. I believe Western cultures have every right to defend their intellectual foundations and to resist any movement seeking to suppress thought, inhibit reason, or return us to archaic dogmas and fables that have claimed too many lives. The point I am making here is not born of infatuation with the West, but of love for free thought and for freedom itself—my aim, and the hope of all humanity.",
    des8: "Western influence is not rooted in hypnotic manipulation; it stems from the values it professes—an appeal to our human desire to accomplish something meaningful within an organised social framework. We are all summoned to realise freedom in its most encompassing sense, in a manner that includes all living beings. Only then can we say that the West’s achievements are not exclusive to the West, nor is its culture self-generated. Western civilisation, as we encounter it today, is the cumulative product of a vast historical and intellectual exchange, constantly moving from one region to another. Its accomplishments have emerged from the finest contributions of many civilisations across the globe, since the dawn of human history and the origins of life on this planet.",
    des9: "Our varied human experiences have taught us that the turning points in history are shaped by a commitment to free and unconstrained thought—thought that embraces both construction and deconstruction, reform and renewal. The legacy of these experiences lives on in France and across the West. Yet it is vital to remember that Western societies are far from perfect; they remain unfinished, still weaving their fabric. That is why they still stand to benefit from the richness brought by individuals of diverse backgrounds and cultures—individuals who carry their own finely woven threads.",
    des10:
      "I hold both criticism and admiration for Western societies, and for France in particular. It was here that I learned to breathe in polluted air and exhale something cleaner—air that opens the heart and clears the mind. But I must also address a malignant problem now afflicting both the West and humanity as a whole. This problem spreads like a virus, and many avoid speaking of it openly, constrained by rigid laws surrounding political correctness and racism—laws which often silence reasoned voices and thoughtful critique. Paradoxically, racism and supremacist attitudes are on the rise, having found fertile ground in a dangerous and insidious form of chauvinism, which I believe is the worst manifestation of racism.",
    des11:
      "When we examine chauvinism closely, we see racism as a developed expression of ethnic egocentrism. In using the word “developed,” I do not mean progressed, for development is not always synonymous with progress. Primitive forms of ethnic identity have evolved from the same root of xenophobia—an instinctual hatred of the foreign. This tendency emerged alongside the formation of social groups, and can be observed among other social creatures as well. In returning to racism, we witness humanity’s regression into an animalistic state. Our accumulated knowledge and philosophical insights have yet to fully tame this primitive impulse, which persists as societies grow and organise themselves.",
    des12:
      "It is true that all peoples and cultures grapple with some aspect of this ancestral inheritance. Humanity is universal, but what sets us apart is our capacity for free thought. What distinguishes one society from another is the extent to which it enshrines civil liberties and human rights in concrete laws that protect individuals—regardless of how radically their thoughts may differ from the prevailing social norms.",
    des13:
      "In my view, the Western populace has failed to live up to the universal values it claims to defend. Chauvinism remains a potent weapon wielded by philistines—those who boast of nothing but their nationality, their legislation, and their intellectual forebears. Today, more than ever, we need an intellectual awakening to restrain Western governments from stoking chauvinism within their native populations through a media that is increasingly tabloid-driven and feudal in tone. Complacency and pride are among the greatest enemies of human progress—and this applies equally, if not more so, to the Western variety.",

    des1: "France, in the context of the reflections above, appears to me as a sum of contradictory emotions stirred each time I utter her name. I feel lost here. Her history of struggle, which led to the downfall of monarchical tyranny and the rejection of any constraint on the freedom of the French people, gives me a certain sense of comfort—perhaps even a justification—for choosing to live here. It is a testimony to what I once believed and still do: that a human being creates her or his own destiny.",
    des2: "We are not born heroes or cowards. Rather, it is the path we choose and the commitments we embrace in this life that shape our fate. Mine, for a specific period, was intertwined with this country—a land that awakens all my mental and psychological energies, offering them a channel to be fulfilled and made visible. I often feel a strong urge to melt into nature, and I cannot dissociate my experiences from my genes. I am, after all, the sum total of inherited influences from my place of origin and the lived experiences that followed.",
    des3: "What I find most compelling about Paris is not its surface glamour, but the city’s reflection of my own infinite quest for freedom—freedom in its deeper, more essential sense, not the superficial attainment of preliminary goals. Freedom begins as a choice, but eventually becomes a commitment—an unwavering fidelity to what one has chosen, regardless of the undesirable consequences that may follow. We seek freedom for its own sake, not out of self-interest or vanity. It is this kind of freedom that propels us towards new ideas and unleashes that vital human energy—so essential to life as air is to breath.",
    des4: "I know Paris will not give me what I seek, for I do not believe that any city or country has ever truly managed to transcend the narrow frames that confine humanity within ethnic or national identities, or rise above the ideas tailored to serve the limited interests of its own people. Yet, at least in Paris, it remains possible for an individual—should she or he wish—to carve out a space amidst these limiting beliefs. One can still claim the right to stand by their ideas and thoughts. (Here, I mean individual liberties and the opening up of intellectual space for research and creative exploration.)",
    des5: "If we look closely at our existence, it becomes clear that this brief journey of life centres around the human pursuit of extending awareness to all living beings. Over millions of years, humans have refined their sensory capacities in order to move gradually beyond themselves—beyond the boundaries of their bodies and their immediate lives. The journey of humanity is a singular one, with a single aim: freedom. And freedom cannot exist without a process of emancipation from our selfish and self-centred desires, which so often hinder our evolution. Only when we elevate our sentiments to this higher plane can we receive new ideas with grace and a deeper engagement.",
    des6: "Freedom. I search for it in all corners of the world, in ideas and visions unchained from specific geographies or narrow identities—ideas that beckon me to delve into the essence of things, to expand across open horizons, to bridge distances, and to feel the pulse of every sentient being as though it were my own. Through understanding what lies outside of me, I come closer to understanding myself. My intellectual path is the sum of that inner self that is latent in all creatures, in all times and places.",
    des7: "Paris reflects the full spectrum of our human nature—its ugliness and its beauty. She attracts all races, nationalities, religions and ideologies, absorbing every psychological and sexual energy imaginable. She rejects no one, yet imposes on all a psychological pressure that often drives one to flee from her. She is like a beautiful woman—so sure of herself—that she has convinced us of her allure, imposing that image upon us as an absolute truth, even when we do not believe in absolutes. She has succeeded in brainwashing us, compelling us to see her as she wishes to be seen, stripping us of our right to question her virtues.",
    des8: "And when we do, we are branded as ignorant of beauty, creativity, or freedom. This city lashes us with a sadistic whip—offering fleeting pleasure but enduring pain. I have never been one for masochism; I cannot accept the treatment, nor the language and foundations Paris imposes. I have learnt to deconstruct and dismantle, to destroy the old chains and worn traditions, and from their rubble I have constructed my own language—my own standards of art, reason and creation.",
    des9: "But does Paris have the eternal right to usurp for herself the title of ‘City of Light’—as though a king staking claim to his throne? My answer draws upon that very term, so evocative of the Enlightenment. What is the Enlightenment, and what does it mean? According to Kant, it is the freedom to judge and reason—a clear vision of what one sees. It is the capacity of the individual to critically assess all traditions, concepts, and authorities, and to recognise the pathways that lead to sound scientific principles. It is not enough to parrot what scientists or theorists proclaim. To be enlightened, we must scrutinise everything with critical subjectivity, and any conclusions drawn must remain always open to challenge and refutation.",
    des10:
      "On these grounds, I believe it is unfair to deprive other cities—cities which have made and continue to make equally valuable contributions to humanity—of the title ‘City of Light’. Paris has long ceased to offer anything of real significance in this regard. She has become like an ageing woman, yielding to the scalpels of cosmetic surgeons in a desperate attempt to revive the allure of a long-lost youth. Today, Paris appears incapable of putting her decaying inner self to rest and being reborn anew.",
    des11:
      "Some will find this judgement harsh—many will be angered by my refusal to join those who have surrendered the keys of beauty to her. That does not concern me. I subject things to my own criteria. I dissect words, principles and concepts, building new judgements from my lived experiences, my readings, and my personal standards. I try to abstract from all nostalgic sentiment born of a vanished past. I feel it is my duty to help Paris liberate herself from the burden of her own nicknames—those very labels that prevent her from rediscovering her essence.",
    des12:
      "In the Enlightenment era, many thinkers and novelists looked to Paris as a source of inspiration, and France as a beacon of light—for she had the courage to confront tyranny. She was the muse of philosophers and poets alike. Yet that should not deter us from questioning her entitlement to retain this title indefinitely. Has not her very history taught us that human beings are at their best when they challenge established ideas? That freedom begins with thought—and thought is the measure of all things? Is not the free individual the ultimate judge of meaning, whose critical gaze reaches towards the infinite?",
    des13:
      "And is it not unjust—towards Paris herself, this city that once fought for freedom—to deny her the chance to renew her inner self by shaking off the shallow labels in which she is now imprisoned? Only then might she invent new ideas and break free from hollow, marginalising expressions. Beauty and creativity are always in flux. A being confined to superficial expressions, dependent on how others perceive him or her, is bound to decay.",
    des14:
      "Because I once loved Paris, I now wish to set her free from all titles. Perhaps then she might rediscover herself and craft new values. Perhaps then I could reunite with her again—and swim once more in the horizons of her rebellion.",
    des15:
      "Much has been said and written about Paris. I found little of it matched what I lived. Perhaps my eyes have grown too accustomed to her architecture, and so now find beauty in contrast—perhaps sight, over time, acquires the ability to detect ugliness in the beautiful and beauty in the ugly.",
    des16:
      "After all these years, I have become like a fish confined to the pristine waters of an ornamented aquarium lined with roses. And yet I yearn for the wild rivers and open seas, indifferent to their murkiness. Yes, I feel as though this city coils around me like a snake, tightening its grip upon my throat, choking my breath. That is why I leave her, time and again—for brief lapses. I do not want her to devour me whole. I am locked in a constant struggle with her aesthetics and her boundless chauvinism.",
    des17:
      "And yet, I must also admit that Paris—precisely as she is—has helped me. She taught me to subvert prevailing notions. I became an astute observer of what others take for granted. She compelled me to fragment all expressions, to reduce them to mere scattered letters, and from there she pushed me to explore the self more deeply, to reach out towards other selves. She stirred within me my long-lost feelings for living beings. She taught me how to transcend hatred and love—how to contain both at once.",
    des18:
      "She taught me, too, how to transform pain into wisdom. She taught me… and yet, I am not entirely sure what she truly taught me in the end. What I do know is that I have come to terms with her, and with myself.",
    des19:
      "I am overwhelmed by conflicting thoughts, so very like this city herself—reflected in the personality of each one of her inhabitants. She is the dazzling beauty in the eyes of the naïve, and the decadent ruin in the eyes of those who cannot see her for who she is. To some, she is a charming thief of fleeting virtues. As for me—I see her as I see myself. She is change. She is the embodiment of change. She contains every expression—beauty and ugliness, shallowness and depth—all at once. She is the sighs and cries of agony from her lovers and her torturers. She is the eternal and ever-changing beloved—forever on the run from the chains of her own captor.",

    des1: "Our Arab societies, one notices, are suffering from a culture shaped by the sin complex, which is firmly and strongly established in our religious doctrines and value systems. We are the grandsons and granddaughters of a culture of self-crucifixion and knowledge-flogging, inheritors of the original sin that is deeply rooted in us. Ours is a culture of hell and torture, engraved in our minds and desires — a culture built over time, gradually becoming entrenched in its doctrines, traditions, and immutable concepts. It does not refrain from criminalising any effort or attempt to soften its coarse and rough teachings. It directs the arrows of its masochists — those who reject all forms of change or renewal — at every form of criticism.",
    des2: "This culture teaches us to submit to humiliation, to fight against science and knowledge, and to belittle ourselves, so that we may perpetuate repression in both its individual and collective forms. But what is the main reason behind the development and endurance of such a repressive culture? There is no doubt that the group has played an important role in shaping individuals within the framework of laws and traditions, which have taken shape over time and transformed into religious concepts that suppress any rebellious attempt in order to preserve the group’s existence and very essence.",
    des3: "It does this by ignoring the individual’s desire. In order to restrain these desires, the group seeks to implant the notions of fate and punishment deep into the minds of individuals. This creates a psychological discrepancy between self-satisfaction and internal images loaded with fear and terror — images that remain in the unconscious. This inner conflict gives rise to a deep sense of guilt. Each time the individual attempts to satisfy their needs, they find themselves overwhelmed by a deterrent tendency stemming from internal images accumulated since early childhood. These images take hold of them completely, leaving them unable to grasp the true extent of the problem. They feel paralysed in the face of these images.",
    des4: "At first, these feelings were reflected in myths, and then materialised in the form of divine religious texts. This projection of inner fears gradually solidified into an external power that restricts individuals and suppresses any attempt to think or behave outside of its repressive framework.",
    des5: "The group has taken it upon itself to fulfil this mission. We see it targeting every individual who has liberated themselves from the shackles and chains of the collective. It wears the robe of the executioner — ignorant of all sciences, knowledge, and historical developments. This tendency is projected onto us in the form of another crisis — one that confuses moral values and basic concepts. The individual lives their entire life hiding behind false masks, practising moral hypocrisy in secret, disturbing the natural balance of things, and forging their history of repeated defeats into imagined glorious victories.",
    des6: "I believe that the primary problem in our societies lies in their fear of confronting themselves and their failure to reconcile individual desires with the collective interest.",
    des7: "Collective Arab culture is constructed on the incitement of individuals to irrational reactions and senseless violence. Our mental faculties are incapable of first identifying emotions in an organised way, and then transforming them into meaningful outcomes. Our actions are simply expressions of random, confused emotions, devoid of any ability to organise either individual or collective behaviour. And when we try to impose order, we find ourselves subjected to accusations and insults.",
    des8: "I am doing my best to identify the causes behind these closed reactions, which remain perpetually frightened of any external threat that might pull them up from their complacent foundations. I try to be understanding of these feelings, but at the same time I am compelled to question the reasons behind the conspiracy of the earth and the universe against this cursed part of the world for so long. I find myself lost in a hopeless search for exceptional inventions, only to find nothing but failure. I search for ethical values, only to find their complete absence. I delude myself into thinking it is worth searching further — perhaps we belong to a culture that could take pride in its remarkable scientific achievements — but I hear nothing other than weeping, moaning, and self-flagellation over a past that has left no trace.",

Undoubtedly, knowledge is built upon accessible information. As the neurologist Jean-Didier Vincent Naccache explains, 'Knowledge is the narrative of the I.'

This is achievable only when we challenge the structure of the 'I', adopt a disposition open to other perspectives, and engage in a continual dual process of deconstruction and reconstruction.",
    des4: "The 'I' is composed of doctrines inherited from the broader collective culture. It acts as a container, enclosing the individual beneath layers of received beliefs, ideas, and assumptions. This broader cultural framework is further overlaid with the familial and educational environments in which we are raised, and all of this interacts with the biological makeup of the individual.

They begin with praise for the sublimity of religious wisdom, claiming its non-human origins as the cornerstone of true knowledge, and proceed to justify the confinement of the individual within a collective mould. Their argument typically ends with a moralistic sermon that continues beyond death itself.",
    des6: "And since we are asked to respect the views of others in the name of understanding, we are often compelled to listen to confused, regurgitated ideas—cloaked in flowery prose and moralistic clichés—that lack novelty and are increasingly out of tune with our time.",
    des7: "Let us examine the foundations of religion more closely. It operates primarily through psychological mechanisms that stir conflicting emotions such as fear and tranquillity, terror and safety. Moreover, religion is devoid of discoveries. Its fossilisation in divine texts explains how religious discourse became closed in on itself, shackled by the very language and concepts that once gave it meaning. It has become its own prisoner, incapable of evolving—a system defined by its immutability.",
    des8: "For this reason, religion fails to inspire or participate in the process of discovery, which is the essence of knowledge. Knowledge emerges through exploration—through the synthesis of analysis, observation, and interpretation of the external world. This synthesis forms the basis for theories that must then be tested and revised. It is therefore neither practical nor logical to build knowledge upon immutable foundations. The mutable and provisional require flexible principles—ones that can be revised, even overturned. Here lies the fundamental problem: religion, by its nature, stands outside the domain of knowledge and thought.",
    des9: "Thus, I find the call to separate religion from knowledge essential. Such separation establishes a protected intellectual space where creativity, innovation, and free thought can flourish. It also fosters a social climate conducive to the productive exchange of ideas.",
    des10:
      "Many philosophers have attempted to define the conditions of thought—David Hume, for example, explored the link between knowledge and sensory impressions. He argued that knowledge is neither precise nor innate, as it depends on individual perception and is reinforced by repetition and experience.",
    des11:
      "Today, biology offers a more grounded explanation than those proposed by early philosophers. Additionally, psychoanalysis and experimental neurology have expanded our understanding of the nervous system, helping us avoid cognitive errors and expand our mental capacities.",
    des12:
      "Contemporary biology offers us a more robust explanation than those put forward by earlier philosophers. Nor should we overlook the contributions of psychoanalysis, particularly in its reliance on experimental neurology to understand the structure and functions of the nervous system. These advances have broadened our capacity to avoid errors, making us less prone to them and more adept at recognising and correcting them. When individuals or groups adhere rigidly to immutable principles that inhibit their ability to learn, such an attitude stifles the brain’s neural development—a process that thrives on learning. It is for this reason that individuals who remain confined within the boundaries of their own fixed concepts struggle to accept challenging ideas or confront disruptive events. This intellectual rigidity results in a kind of stagnation—a mental standstill in which the individual is unable to live in their time or adapt to the transformations occurring within it. The richness of thought cannot flourish without the nourishment of diverse experiences and the stimulus of collective intellectual exchange. This is why we assert that religion must be restored to its proper domain: the realm of emotion and feeling.",
    des13:
      "There is no doubt that each of us perceives the world and external reality in unique ways, for perception itself is constructed through mental visualisations shaped by our convictions and interpretations—those ideas accumulated and expressed in the form of the 'I'. We must continuously strive to reassess the data upon which this inner structure is built. Such reassessment is possible only through critical inquiry, an ongoing openness to ideas that differ from our own, and a willingness to acknowledge both our fallibility and the inherently limited, provisional nature of the knowledge and awareness we possess. For error and awareness are inextricably linked—they represent the sum of our efforts to reach a more expansive consciousness of all that lies beyond us.",

This experience has evolved through observation and the study of natural phenomena, acquiring layered complexity across time.",
    des3: "Internal perception itself is further divided into individual cognitive experiences operating within a broader collective consciousness. This creates an ongoing interplay between the individual and the group. At times, individual insight enriches the collective, introducing new values or principles. Yet, in other instances, such personal experiences can produce psychological effects that, when unconsciously absorbed by individuals, harden into automatic behaviours and fixed beliefs—resistant to change or reinterpretation. This rigidity imprisons the individual within a narrow and inflexible framework, as seen in religious doctrines clinging to primitive moral codes no longer suitable for contemporary life, and whose continuation, in their current form, stands in stark contradiction to science and modern knowledge.",
    des4: "Before addressing the religious dimension within individuals and communities, I wish to explore the nature of internal perception and the fragile mental images that often dominate those who experience them. In particular, I refer to prophets and messengers, and the link between prophecy, high altitudes (such as mountain ascents), and fasting. Take, for example, Moses ascending the mountain to receive the Ten Commandments.",
    des5: "To understand this phenomenon, we must examine the role of hypoxaemia—a deficiency of oxygen in the blood—which occurs at high altitudes and is known to affect activity in the temporal lobe of the brain. Factors that can induce hypoxaemia include elevation, rapid ascent, and intense physical exertion.",
    des6: "Studies of hallucinations and delirium experienced by mountain climbers—often symptoms of altitude sickness—shed light on why individuals seeking divine contact may have gravitated towards elevated terrains. Fasting, too, plays a key role. Moses is said to have fasted before his encounter with God. Starving the body alters brain function and can induce states akin to delirium.",
    des7: "Hence, fasting and ritual deprivation have long been part of spiritual preparation among numerous tribal cultures—such as Native American rites—described by Michael Persinger as part of what he terms the 'God experience'. Over time, this extreme deprivation was institutionalised in milder forms as partial fasting and incorporated into the obligatory practices of organised religions.",
    des8: "Persinger drew a critical distinction between the experience of God and the concept of God. He considered the former a subjective, internal phenomenon—an intense perceptual episode often marked by overwhelming emotion, an inner sense of revelation, and even auditory phenomena interpreted as the divine voice.",
    des9: "If we examine these internal perceptual experiences—whether interpreted as cosmic energy, universal consciousness, or a divine creator—we find they frequently arise from changes in brain activity. Such states may occur during periods of emotional crisis, exhaustion, psychological vulnerability, or personal transformation. These conditions enable the emergence of rich emotional states—feelings of psychological depth, fullness, or transcendence—that closely resemble hallucinations or perceptual distortions recorded by the brain in the absence of any corresponding external reality.",
    des10:
      "These hallucinations are conscious mental representations devoid of an external referent. They are internal perceptions projected onto an imagined outer reality, not unlike the experience of 'God' as felt by some—an inward perception not anchored in objective, observable fact.",
    des11:
      "Undoubtedly, for many individuals, the experience of 'God' was not a wilful act but rather the result of involuntary internal processes shaped by psychological tension and a desperate desire to escape one’s inner reality.",
    des12:
      "Returning to the prophets and their experiences of revelation: we find individuals who became immersed in internal perception, caught in prolonged hallucinations and states of delirium. Their experiences were not the result of a premeditated plan, but rather of heightened sensitivity and acute intuition—qualities that allowed them to seize moments of cultural and psychological opportunity.",
    des13:
      "What is often referred to as the 'sixth sense' may be nothing more than an accumulation of personal and collective experience stored in long-term memory, allowing for a certain predictive capacity or anticipatory insight.",

      "We often speak rashly of fables and myths, ridiculing their meaning and principles as relics of a bygone era. Yet what many fail to recognise is their omnipresence and their elusive, enduring influence. It is often difficult to grasp the extent to which they are embedded in our everyday practices and firmly held beliefs. This failure of recognition is, in part, due to the silent absorption of myths and fables into religion, where they have been preserved, nurtured, and reinvented as divine miracles.",
    des1: "That said, the vital role myths and fables played in the evolution and development of numerous civilisations must not be overlooked or dismissed. Myths were essential to the formation of civic values that enabled the smooth functioning of daily life. They helped instil respect for private property and shaped the organisation of society—from the family unit to larger social structures. Fables served as powerful tools that strengthened individuals’ adherence to societal norms, even though this process has undoubtedly claimed countless innocent lives throughout history. Fables evolved into myths, taboos, and prohibitions, which gradually coalesced into religions. These, in turn, gave rise to the concept of God—its most fertile breeding ground.",
    des2: "In time, gods and their laws adapted to the customs and traditions of the societies that embraced them. For example, the Roman adoption of Christianity involved a reinterpretation of pagan festivals. What is now celebrated as the birth of Christ was originally a Roman feast marking the birth of the sun. It was only later that the Church designated the same date to commemorate Christ’s nativity. Similarly, Easter rituals echo the death and resurrection of the Phoenician deity Adonis. Numerous parallels can be drawn between Christian traditions and earlier pagan religions.",
    des3: "The image I would like to focus on at this stage of analysis is the myth of the virgin birth in Christianity. Similar narratives can be found in the ancient civilisations of Egypt, Greece, and India. They also appear among tribal societies where sexual intercourse was not yet directly linked to human reproduction. Tribes practising totemic beliefs established kinship ties between themselves and various forms of life, especially animals and plants. It was widely believed that when a woman gave birth and endured labour pains, she had to recall what she had seen, eaten, or thought about before going into labour. A connection was thus made between the event of birth and a particular plant or animal, with the newborn assigned the corresponding totem. As explained by the anthropologist James Frazer, primitive myths lay at the foundation of totemic religions. So although the notion of a virgin birth appeared among many tribes, it gained a sacred, mysterious dimension in the spiritual context of the Virgin Mother.",
    des4: "Fables and myths are not the exclusive domain of any one religion; rather, they form a shared basis for all religions. I have chosen to begin with the relationship between Christianity and pagan mythology to avoid provoking the oversensitivity of Muslim cultures or being accused of antisemitism had I begun with the myths underlying Judaism. I considered it safer to draw on Christianity—a religion that no longer wields political or judicial power. Moreover, the majority of Christian believers would likely not take offence at the above critique of the parallels between myth and religious tradition.",
    des5: "It is important to recognise that the laws and rituals of all religions are borrowed from pre-existing beliefs. It is virtually impossible for a religion to completely erase the beliefs already held by its converts. That is why every religion inhabits older forms of faith. It is not simply built atop existing cultural and moral systems, but is closely connected to them, preserving and reproducing them in new forms within a unified religious discourse. Religion emerges through this subtle and intricate historical process and is further shaped by environmental and climatic conditions throughout its expansion. According to Will Durant, religion reinforces moral law in two primary ways: through myths and through taboos. Myths nurture belief in supernatural and metaphysical forces. Traces of ancient or pagan beliefs can be found in every new law and article of faith across cultures and societies. These foundations become more evident when we examine the early and primitive beginnings of religion.",
    des6: "Returning to fables and to the real and symbolic sacrifices once made to appease spirits thought to govern the natural world: power was eventually transferred to a supreme deity. This divine omnipotence remains with us today, deeply ingrained in modern consciousness. Sacrifices are still performed in the name of a widely venerated deity, exalted by worshippers as the Almighty.",
    des7: "Primitive humans were crippled by fear of the natural phenomena they could not comprehend. In their inability to control or understand such forces, they began to worship them. Hoping to appease what they could not explain, they offered sacrifices at its altar. Over time, this incomprehensible and wrathful nature was deified. Every society developed its own conception of this god. In some Mexican tribes, the Aztecs executed ritual sacrifices by killing selected individuals believed to embody the divine. The victims were skinned alive in a ritual thought to grant eternal youth and everlasting life. For them, death was the gateway to eternity.",
    des8: "Human history is marked by a tireless pursuit of eternity and a refusal to accept death. This is perhaps best symbolised by the biblical figures of Adam and Eve, whose endless and incomplete journey towards knowledge serves to confront the universal fear of mortality. Once granted eternal life, they lost it for having disobeyed their creator in their quest for knowledge—thus, death became their punishment. This universal tale, echoed in various local traditions, is the symptom of a deity fabricated by humankind. This man-made god, in essence, seeks nothing but obedience—an enslaved following, easily exploited and controlled by his earthly representatives.",
    des9: "Deep down, humans have always known they possess the power to dismantle this deity and all his accompanying myths and fables. But to do so would also mean confronting the end of the dream of eternity, a vision that first appeared in the minds of early humans at the dawn of history. The notion of death was always an intolerable one, prompting the invention of countless strategies to defy its finality—from magic and shamanism to taboos and prohibitions. These systems aimed to delay the spirit’s departure from the body or to imagine its return in another life. Humankind’s failure to create eternity led it to project its deepest desires onto external forces embodied in nature. Thus were born extraordinary, mysterious powers, which evolved into increasingly complex forms. Onto these creations, the human mind projected its repressed instincts—those censured by the community—and transformed them into paradises and afterlives filled with all that was forbidden in this life: rivers of wine, honey, and milk, and endless legions of virgins awaiting the believer beyond the veil of death.",
    des10:
      "What is most striking about this blurred transition from the concept of death to that of God is the uncritical acceptance by vast swathes of humanity of religious myths. We might understand how primitive societies were bound by the spirits of their ancestors and the traditions of their unlettered environments. It is difficult for any individual to sever ties with such deeply rooted customs. What truly confounds the mind, however, is the condition of modern societies—entire populations blindly aligning themselves with religious myths, rallying behind impotent leaders who offer them nothing of substance. Have we not wronged ourselves by embracing monotheistic religions and, in doing so, reconfiguring our thinking into a monotheistic, totalitarian mindset—one god, one idea, one leader?",

      "Psychology, in its various schools and branches, has offered us a deeper understanding of the self and of our inner psychological stirrings. Yet some still cast doubt on its status as a science—a scepticism which, in my view, arises less from objective reasoning than from deeply rooted beliefs and psychological resistance. This hesitancy may, in part, be traced back to the early stance of the behaviourist school, which rejected mental processes as legitimate explanations for observable behaviour. Behaviourists remained firmly opposed to concepts such as consciousness and the unconscious, while cognitive psychology initially adopted a neutral position, only later beginning to engage with these notions in earnest in the 1980s.",
    des1: "Today, we observe a growing convergence between dynamic psychology (psychoanalysis) and cognitive science. Both psychological schools and the field of neuroscience increasingly agree that most human and animal behaviours stem from underlying, unconscious processes. Following Bowers’ 1984 experiment—and subsequent studies such as those by Weinberger and Hardaway in 1990—researchers from both traditions reached the conclusion that unconscious representations play a fundamental role in shaping our thoughts and emotions. In essence, the majority of our cognitive, emotional, and motivational processes are unconscious by nature. Consciousness, by contrast, is limited in scope. Its primary function lies in enabling self-awareness of thoughts and feelings, thereby helping us to adapt by constructing a dynamic relationship with our environment. It also serves as a regulator of thought and behaviour.",
    des2: "The 2000 experiment by Naccache and Dehaene demonstrated that consciousness can determine the psychological and neurological outcomes of unconscious cognitive operations—that is, consciousness can influence unconscious mental representations. This opens the door to practices such as self-suggestion, which allow us to modify certain behaviours or pursue specific desires by consciously encoding motivating cues that are later activated unconsciously, or by formulating conscious strategies that affect deeper, unconscious mechanisms. Conversely, the unconscious influences us through a bottom-up process, wherein information rises from the depths of the psyche into conscious awareness.",
    des3: "Two mechanisms are thus at play: the descent from consciousness into the unconscious (top-down), and the ascent from the unconscious into consciousness (bottom-up). The older idea—held by some—that the unconscious is primitive and fixed no longer holds ground in contemporary science. On the contrary, psychology and neuroscience have demonstrated that unconscious mental processes are intelligent, adaptive, and capable of transformation.",
    des4: "Learning, for instance, alters synaptic connections in the brain, and this change is aided by structural codes that operate unconsciously. The learning process begins with a conscious intention, but is gradually transferred to unconscious processes, ultimately becoming a rich, generative activity governed by the unconscious mind.",
    des5: "Our unconscious is able to solve problems we are consciously aware of by drawing upon a vast repository of data across multiple neural networks, which it coordinates and analyses to produce several independent solutions simultaneously. By contrast, consciousness is narrow in scope, capable of representing only one scene at a time. This is why thousands of unconscious representations hover at the threshold of awareness, awaiting the right moment for selection. Their emergence is neither random nor chaotic, but governed by the presence of specific enabling conditions. To enter consciousness, a representation must surpass certain thresholds of intensity and duration—what scientists call the “critical threshold.” Yet despite these constraints, consciousness is more flexible than the unconscious. It can create a broad picture composed of multiple elements, whereas the unconscious operates more like a series of expert teams, each addressing a different facet of the same problem. Technically speaking, consciousness redistributes neural activity across networks active at a given moment, activating the shared processes necessary to achieve a specific objective. It then selects the most suitable unconscious solution while inhibiting the others deemed less compelling.",
    des6: "Modern neuroscience intersects with Freudian thought in affirming the richness of unconscious mental life—a truth substantiated by contemporary neurophysiological research. Both fields also agree that any consciously willed act originates in an unconscious mental representation, as illustrated in Benjamin Libet’s famous experiment. His findings revealed that neural encoding precedes conscious decision-making, suggesting that the act of choosing is itself shaped by prior unconscious processes.",
    des7: "Despite the historical divergences between neuroscience and Freudian theory, we are now witnessing a form of reconciliation between formerly opposing schools. Each holds a partial truth. Today, psychology increasingly turns to adjacent sciences—most notably neuroscience—to ground its theories in biological reality. As Henri Laborit aptly observed: “If biology is the science of life, why should we hesitate to see the human sciences as part of it? The isolation of any school of thought ultimately results in the closure of thought itself, and of the very structure of knowledge.”",

If God is indeed so merciful and generous, then surely His followers must exhibit patience towards those who hesitate—those who seek the truth not through blind adherence, but through their own intellectual effort and introspection, rather than rushing into the comfortable complacency of a preordained faith. And if this strong and mighty God is capable of guiding whomever He wishes, would that not suggest that one of the expressions of His divine wisdom is to bring forth individuals who do not believe in Him at all? If so, then believers ought to refrain from preaching, fall into silence, and surrender to the will of their God—He who, presumably, best understands the mysterious workings of the unknown.",
    des1: "What, then, is it that troubles the devout? Are they not content, basking in the infinite embrace of their Creator? Why, then, would they feel threatened by that which lies beyond the perimeters of their religious universe?",
    des2: "I believe the disquiet that some believers express towards non-believers stems from a deeper anxiety—a resentment towards the atheist’s ability to roam freely and unbound across divine realms, to explore the cosmos without restriction, in search of meaning, and perhaps to touch the essence of freedom itself. Those in bondage often desire nothing more than to see others shackled alongside them. They envy liberty even as they vilify it. And when they witness someone who has broken free from the chains of subjugation, they look on with bitterness and disdain. For the slave, freedom is neither understood nor realised—it exists only as a mirage, a dream beyond their grasp. Their intellect, long confined to the inscribed symbols and dogmas of their holy texts, is unable to interpret their own feelings and inner experiences. True understanding is not handed down; it is reached through affects—those internal movements that mediate between raw emotional energy and outward action.",
    des3: "Perception itself is a creative, generative force. But this is precisely what is absent in the religious mindset. Most believers lack the intellectual faculties to engage with the experience of creativity. Instead, they capitulate entirely to expressions and ideas that were formulated in another age, by others. The problem is not belief per se, but the docile and obedient mentality of the faithful—those who accept, without question, all that is dictated to them. They do not possess the tools to examine the world through the prisms of science or logic, nor do they make the effort to translate their experiences into independent understanding.",
    des4: "I often find myself wondering why it is that individuals from certain communities—particularly religious ones—find new ideas so deeply unsettling. This persistent resistance is symptomatic of a chronic pathology bound tightly to their conception of God and belief. Their God is imagined as immutable, absolute, flawless—a supreme entity whose perfection is central to their sense of identity. This image of the divine becomes a kind of psychological refuge: familiar, fixed, and immune to critique. The devout adorn this God with endless accolades, celebrating His strength and might. But is this God truly so powerful and omnipotent as they claim? Is He genuinely able to achieve anything, to grant His followers victory over all adversaries?",
    des5: "But let us first take a close look at this God from a purely objective perspective. Let us see how His own followers describe Him. This anthropomorphic God appears to suffer from a series of human psychological complexes—sadism, irritation, self-aggrandisement, and arrogant pride. Look at some of His ninety-nine “Beautiful Names”: Allah, Al-Muhaymin—the All-Seeing, the All-Powerful One; Al-Jabbar—the One under whose dominion nothing occurs except by His will. The word Jabbar literally signifies tyranny and oppression. Al-Mutakabbir—literally “the Haughty One,” here taken to signify God’s absolute elevation above His creatures. Al-Qahhar—the Subduer, who possesses perfect Power and is never incapable of anything. Al-Muthil—the One who bestows honour upon whomever He wills, such that no one can disgrace him; and who degrades whomever He wills, such that no one can elevate him. Al-Qawiyy—the One endowed with complete and unchallenged Power. Al-Muqtadir—the Omnipotent, from whom nothing can be withheld. Al-Muntaqim—the Avenger, who prevails over His enemies, punishes them for their sins, and has the power to destroy them.",
    des6: "This selection from Allah’s pantheon of “Beautiful Names” conjures not a divine and transcendent being, but rather a profoundly human figure—one burdened with psychological afflictions. And if we were to begin compiling an inventory of this God’s illnesses, I doubt we would reach the end of that list for days to come. Yet what matters more than the symptoms is understanding the cause of these chronic pathologies. In truth, these attributes have nothing to do with any actual God. They are projections of human conflict—of a desire by some to exert control and domination over the many, or even just over each other. In another sense, the concept of God is a direct result of humanity’s relentless pursuit of knowledge and perfection. God becomes the externalised and idealised embodiment of absolute mastery—an objectified idea of total knowledge and power, placed outside the self and set before it as an unattainable standard.",
    des7: "Let me return to the issue of God’s chronic pathologies, often misrepresented as His divine attributes. The morbid fascination with destruction and the hypocrisy masquerading as truthfulness and generosity are, in reality, human psychological maladies. These traits are characteristic of those who seek to control their fellow men and women through ruthless means. A defining feature of this collective (divine) ailment is the unwavering adherence to a singular perspective and a narrow field of vision. This constrained perception is incapable of acknowledging or understanding differing ideas and opinions; it is highly irritable and prone to violence, unhesitant in extinguishing anything that opposes it. Those who embody and perpetuate this mindset cannot conceive of thought beyond the confines of their religions and cultures. They are thus distanced from the merciful, peaceful, generous, and all-loving One. Am I mistaken in considering that the very existence of this One relies on the numbing and suppression of our intellects?",
    des8: "If my assessment of this God is flawed, perhaps due to my ignorance of His essence, would His followers not be better served by emulating His purported forgiveness, rather than exhibiting intolerance and hostility towards those who dissent? Why do they persistently defend their God? Is He not deemed capable of protecting Himself? By taking it upon themselves to determine the fate of non-believers, are they not contradicting their own teachings and casting doubt upon God’s omnipotence?",
    des9: "I suspect that, deep down, believers struggle to place their faith in such a frail and impotent deity, one incapable of harming even the smallest fly. They experience constant inner turmoil, torn between reason and myth, science and ignorance. Yet, driven by a profound desire to belong to a collective entity, they construct this divine edifice and embed it within their subconscious, where it transforms into a bottomless abyss. This is how they embark upon a doomed path—a journey marked by misery, resentment, and illusions. In this state, they find themselves unable to reconcile with their innate impulses and desires. These drives, seemingly banished from the external world, are indulged in secret, with pathological fervour. Indeed, they appear incapable of mastering their own biological needs.",

      "According to Wilhelm Reich, the religious mechanisms to which inexperienced individuals and groups resort as a means to understand the world and interpret events can collapse at any moment. When this occurs, various opportunities to explore and comprehend life present themselves to the intellect. Life and liberty are not distinct entities, nor are they bestowed upon us; we can only approach them through successive attempts to understand and interpret them in rational and logical ways.",
    des11:
      "We must be vigilant of the subtle mechanisms of brainwashing employed by spiritual and political leaders, alongside the collective social body. Our most esteemed electronic platforms and print newspapers appear to engage actively in research and publication. However, the truth is that much of this has little to do with culture and freethinking. Their readers are continually dulled, inhaling the carcinogenic toxins of religious faith or being entertained with the usual tabloid stories. It is rather laughable when one repeatedly hears the question of why Arab nations remain incapable of participating in or contributing to development and progress. Such advancements can never emerge from a culture fixated on the immutable and divinely perfect One. The politics of oppression, whether exercised by religious or political power, share the same origins and causes. We cannot demand any form of freedom without securing the intellectual and cultural liberty of the individual. We need to embrace individualism and the emancipation of men and women from all obstacles and chains that hinder their creative impulses. We must adopt ethics born from the self and diminish the influence of mandatory ethics instilled by religious texts. Perhaps we should construct our ethics on a more open and comprehensive connection with all living creatures, rather than with a god of our own making.",
    des12:
      "Now, more than ever, we need to shake off the dust of fear from our deepest thoughts. We must reject all forms of power that seek to shackle the individual, keeping them humiliated and subjected to perpetual slavery. No ethical foundation can be found in a man or woman stripped of their humanity, ensconced in their religious, racial, or gendered shell. If both believers and atheists among us are united in the pursuit of defeating oppression and injustice, then we must oppose all its forms and practices. There is no freedom without reliance on self-criticism, inference, and judgment—all of which must originate from the individual themselves. We need to believe in ourselves first, and then delve deeper into our human depths to find that little ego disguised as a god.",
    des13:
      "In conclusion, I can only say that our Arab cultures will always remain subjected to humiliation and oppression as long as they possess nothing other than god. Our cultures, with their diverse yet antagonistic religious faiths, derive their sole solace from the false pride of being the cradle of three major religions, of being god’s chosen people—the people He has elected to remain tucked by His side, lost in their infinite slumber.",

If we examine its origins, we discover that early humans, lacking the tools to understand their environment, attempted to explain natural phenomena through personified forces. Their ignorance, mingled with fear and desire, gave rise to imagined spirits and powers that eventually became gods. In this way, myth carved a pathway to divinity, infiltrating and, over time, dominating its meaning.",
    des7: "Looking back at ancient civilisations, we see that the concept of a divine hero or god-king formed the basis of the creator god. At the time, sorcerers were able to expand their political—and later religious—influence over communities paralysed by fear and ignorance. Today’s god still draws his authority from the ignorance of individuals and the limits of their imagination, assuming the role of eternal executioner and ultimate tyrant.",
    des8: "The magical god and the creator god are, in essence, one and the same—both sustained by the primitive mindsets of early communities. The fundamental basis of all deities rests on internal psychological drives interacting with the external environment—between an individual’s thoughts, often saturated with fantasy, and the surrounding material world.",
    des9: "In ancient societies, the unique experiences of certain individuals—whether through social insight or the capacity to diagnose and treat illness—allowed them to dominate the collective. These figures were elevated first to the status of sorcerers, and later to divine rulers.",
    des10: "But what, exactly, are the rules of magic?",
    des11:
      "James Frazer divided magic into two categories:\n- a negative form, expressed through taboos,\n- and a positive form, expressed through sorcery.",
    des12: "Together, these formed the structural pillars of the divine.",
    des13: "Sorcery says: “Do this to obtain that.”",
    des14: "Taboo warns: “Do not do this, or misfortune will befall you.”",
    des15:
      "In both cases, the goal is the same: to secure what is desirable and avoid what is harmful. In this sense, the objectives of magic and religion are identical. Just as magic calls for rituals, chants, and sometimes sacrifices, religion demands worship and devotion.",
    des16:
      "The sorcerer's power depended on upholding magical rites. Through this control of ritual, he was able to secure his place within the tribe and often ascend to political or spiritual leadership. The god, too, sustains his dominance through the worship of individuals and groups. Magical rituals gradually evolved into religious rites, but the function remained largely unchanged. Faith became a tool to control both body and mind. The deeper people sank into religious devotion, the more their psychological constitution yielded to illusion and myth. This not only impaired their ability to absorb scientific knowledge, but also eroded their capacity to understand others. Trapped in a narrow mental space, they became prisoners of their own fearful imaginings.",
    des17:
      "One can easily understand why, in later periods, religion turned against magic. The two had coexisted for some time, often working in tandem. But eventually, religion emerged as the dominant force. Still, their foundations remain linked. Just as the sorcerer once claimed to mediate with spirits, so too does the religious authority today—only now, it is not just the clerics, but much of Arab society that serves as agents for religion and its god.",
    des18:
      "I return now to our newspapers—Al Jazeera, Al-Quds Al-Arabi—and their credibility when it comes to science, knowledge, and information. Their intellectual barrenness in handling facts, and their simplistic attempts at manipulating the minds of their readership, are astonishing.",
    des19:
      "I can only offer two explanations:\nEither a profound ignorance of foreign languages, or a deliberate distortion aimed at affirming belief in God.",

    description:
      "For much of human history, people lived in a state of unconsciousness, driven by primal urges and the instinctive pursuit of their satisfaction. Yet the need for safety—and protection from predatory creatures—compelled humans to seek refuge in the collective. Thus began a long journey towards individual consciousness.",
    des2: "This awareness did not emerge in isolation, but was shaped by the surrounding culture, which gradually established itself as a force designed to restrain unconscious impulses and regulate human behaviour in the interest of communal welfare. Culture initially took form through customs and traditions—patterns of individual conduct that had been filtered, refined, and preserved by the collective across generations.",
    des3: "One of the earliest domains culture sought to control was sexuality. What began as an effort to confine sexual behaviour within the boundaries of family later evolved into prohibitions, first through mythology, then institutionalised by religion.",
    des4: "As communities matured, they assumed responsibility for restricting individual freedom by codifying behaviour through unwritten laws. The notion of justice and punishment arose from these cultural norms, aiming to subdue the innate tendencies towards violence and hostility present in human nature. Yet the rebellious spirit persisted within the individual, prompting society to sanctify its rules by linking them to divine authority—a force stronger than tradition itself. In this way, the suppression of instinct was no longer merely cultural, but spiritual.",
    des5: "Divine punishment, then, drew its power from deep within the psyche. The individual found themselves locked in an internal conflict: between the ego, which seeks to fulfil instinctual desires, and the superego, the internalised judge representing societal values and prohibitions. This conflict produced a profound sense of guilt—born from the pressure exerted by the superego upon the ego—which in turn led to a subconscious form of self-punishment, projected outwardly as divine retribution.",
    des6: "Unaware of the psychological origins of this struggle, the individual interpreted it through myth: as punishment from a Creator angered by human disobedience. In this way, the divine acquired a moral and spiritual dimension, becoming a projection of the superego, and embedding itself further within the framework of culture.",
    des7: "Culture, then, is a set of values, customs, and prohibitions recognised by a given community. It operates as an external force capable of restraining violent impulses and shaping human behaviour. Though cultures differ and evolve over time, their ultimate goal remains the same: the advancement of human thought through peaceful coexistence, equality among peoples, and a sense of compassion for all living beings.",
    des8: "To reach that ideal, culture initially adopted a repressive guise, embedding its principles first in conscious thought, then—through repetition and social pressure—into the unconscious, where they became integral to the human psyche. Once these values took root, culture could begin to ease its grip, allowing for greater individual freedom within the collective.",
    des9: "However, in some societies, this transformation stalled. In the Middle East, for instance, culture became inseparably fused with divinity. Feelings of guilt towards the divine became deeply entrenched, beginning with the myth of the original sin—Adam and Eve’s transgression—designed to bind the entire community under the authority of religion.",
    des10:
      "Over time, individual attempts at rebellion emerged, often in the form of prophets who sought to liberate humanity from this inherited guilt. Yet despite their intentions, these figures often fell into the very trap they sought to dismantle. Rather than dissolve the burden of guilt, they inadvertently reinforced it, as their messages were absorbed and redirected by the collective superego, which subsumed their movements into the dominant moral structure.",
    des11:
      "The collective superego thus managed to co-opt these efforts, creating internal contradictions within the prophets themselves—between their original aim of liberation and the eventual outcome of their missions. These revolts were not purely personal initiatives, but rather expressions of an unconscious collective yearning to break free from cultural and institutional authority.",
    des12:
      "Christ, for instance, challenged the religious establishment of his time, just as Socrates defied the prevailing norms of Athenian society. Both faced death for their ideas. But while Socrates contributed to the emergence of secular, rational thought in Europe—detaching culture from divine origin—Christ’s message deepened the association between morality and divine judgment, reinforcing the structure of guilt. Yet in both cases, the outcome was the same: the system resisted and extinguished their challenge.",
    des13:
      "Thus, those who rebelled against the dominant cultural order were, in a sense, responding to a latent collective desire for transformation—though they may have misunderstood the full implications of their mission.",
    des14:
      "This leads us to a pressing question: Why has the Middle East, more than any other region, produced so many prophets and divine figures? Was it because the cultures of this region were particularly repressive, expressing unconscious human drives more intensely? Or was it that the strong individual egos of these prophets drove them to bind culture to the divine, and thereby to themselves?",
    des15:
      "What is certain is that the conflation of culture and divinity became deeply embedded in the collective unconscious of the region’s inhabitants. As a result, the existence of both individual and community became inextricably linked to the existence of God. And with this came a profound obstacle: any individual attempt to break free from this collective destiny is met not with curiosity, but with rejection—and often, erasure.",

      "Over the ages, humankind has endured various forms of self-inflicted violence and oppression. With the gradual establishment of principles promoting social justice and equality, this age-old tendency towards violence and self-destruction has been tempered—but not entirely overcome. Narrow self-interest still animates the ego, driving individuals to cling to racist doctrines and acts of discrimination.",
    des2: "Racist attitudes can often be understood as sublimated frustrations of individuals no longer capable of innovation or creativity. They conveniently find fertile ground in unimaginative and unoriginal minds. When individuals or small groups fall back on explicit or unspoken racist doctrines to justify their supposed moral superiority, they devote much of their time and energy to fabricating excuses for subjugating and persecuting others—be they individuals, ethnic groups, or other social formations cast into the role of ‘the other’.",
    des3: "Looking broadly at the unfolding of this vast human drama throughout history, one is left with a powerful conclusion: that humanity’s intellectual evolution, and its gradual move towards a deeper understanding of human nature, only became possible when consciousness and perception extended beyond the narrow confines of the ego.",
    des4: "Humankind has fought—and continues to fight—racism in all its varied shapes and forms. At times it targets skin colour, at others religious belief, or even a specific gender.",
    des5: "However, what tends to be forgotten—or rather, not openly discussed—are those other forms of racism that rarely meet with condemnation or scrutiny. Despite the rising tide of human empathy and the ideal of fraternity, we often fall short of our humanity, even while boasting of our greatness. The ego remains a wall between humankind and its own human essence—between the species and that which makes it truly human.",
    des6: "In principle, what defines humanity is its grounding in a dual consciousness: one that turns inward to engage with internal psychological states, and another that reaches outward towards the surrounding physical world. This balanced dual movement enables us to seek a way of life that harmoniously accommodates and coexists with diverse individuals and cultures. This is our true responsibility—towards our own humanity, and towards all living beings.",
    des7: "Despite the great strides humankind has made—from the dark ages of ignorance to an era of enlightenment—we have not managed to overcome the primitive anxiety buried deep within our collective psyche. This anxiety is sublimated in practices where individuals or groups enslave animals or other human beings. This primal urge to dominate and exert power over others destroys the very notion of free will and choice.",
    des8: "Those who justify the slaughter of animals as necessary for nourishment should consider recent health research indicating that a vegetarian diet is the most suitable for the human body. Such primitive and unreflective behaviours are driven by entrenched habits that govern our treatment of the unfamiliar or the different. As a result, our ability to open our minds to more evolved levels of perception is lost. These behaviours may be rooted in distant ancestral memories—false victories over anxiety gained through dominance over other life forms.",
    des9: "Early humans had limited means to survive in a hostile natural environment. They killed one another out of competition for scarce resources. But with the passage of time and the invention of agriculture, humankind embarked on a long journey towards higher consciousness—culminating in civilisations where life offered more options than those dictated by sheer necessity. And yet, some people still cling to primitive, racist practices and beliefs—perhaps in a desperate attempt to fill the bottomless void that exists within their minds.",
    des10:
      "All the arguments and justifications presented to uphold systems of distinction and discrimination must be continually refuted. Whatever the target of discrimination, the underlying principle remains the same: to deny the other’s right to life and dignity on the grounds of perceived worthlessness. These excuses used to legitimise racist violence are symptoms of narrowed perception and an inability to engage with that which we do not understand.",
    des11:
      "Discrimination and racism have often been justified by alleged inequalities in intellectual or creative capacity. Have women not, throughout the ages, been treated as lesser beings and relegated to the status of second-class citizens? Has anti-Semitism not been rationalised by the vile claim that Jews are a cursed people, unworthy of life? Have not all religions, in one way or another, resorted to discrimination by promoting the notion of a chosen people and denying equality to all in the eyes of God?",
    des12:
      "Through the power of reason and intellect, humankind has risen above many of these primitive beliefs and condemned racist practices. Yet, despite this progress, we consistently fail to take seriously the discrimination committed against animals. As Isaac Bashevis Singer once wrote, “In relation to them, all people are Nazis; for the animals, it is an eternal Treblinka.”",
    des13:
      "Take a moment to look at the meat dishes we consume daily. What is so appetising about this barbaric spectacle, which should instead serve as a reminder of our cruelty towards animals? As Tolstoy observed: “By killing, man suppresses in himself, unnecessarily, the highest spiritual capacity—that of sympathy and pity towards living creatures like himself—and by violating his own feelings becomes cruel.” If we have turned our bodies and stomachs into graveyards for dead animals, how can we expect to build a better future?",
    des14:
      "To this day, many individuals and cultures continue to accept the routine slaughter of animals. They confine the value of life to human beings alone, believing that only human consciousness is capable of fostering progress. But life is not the sole preserve of humankind—it exists in all living creatures. And if we deny animals the right to live because they offer no contribution to human advancement, should we not then also eliminate all human beings who fail to contribute? Not every human adds something to the future of our species—but does that mean they do not deserve to live?",
    des15:
      "A genuine vision of human progress must be rooted in sympathy for the other—whether that other is human or another form of life. This very sentiment of sympathy led us to protect the environment once we became fully aware of its vital role in sustaining life. There is a clear connection between our excessive consumption of animal meat and the destruction of the natural world.",

The transportation of products to feed livestock is responsible for 2.4 billion tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions each year.” He also highlighted the enormous quantities of water and produce consumed by animals raised for human consumption—between 5,000 and 25,000 litres of water are needed to produce just one kilogram of animal protein, compared with only 10 litres for the same amount of vegetable protein.",
    des18:
      "Wealthy nations buy, on average, 80% of their livestock feed from poorer countries, many of which suffer from extreme malnutrition. Brazil, for instance, exports 70% of its agricultural production to rich countries—an amount that could instead feed its own hungry population. Economist Jeremy Rifkin estimates that the world’s crop production used to feed livestock—approximately 670 million tonnes—could nourish 850 million people suffering from hunger.",

These transformations result in the emergence of new characteristics that help societies expand and progress. Such transitional periods are often accompanied by significant obstacles, frequently posed by religious groups entrenched in positions of power or closely allied with authoritarian regimes.",
    des1: "While the conditions that enable transformation differ from one society to another—each shaped by its own ideological, economic, and social realities—examining the experiences of certain countries and communities, and studying the factors and motivations behind the success of their transitional processes, can provide valuable insight and inspiration.",
    des2: "Let us, for instance, consider the European experience in the eighteenth century and examine the forces that enabled it to liberate itself from the grip of theologians. At the time, Europe was grappling with the oppression of minority sects and the pervasive control of the Church over science and media. Clerics refused to tolerate any individual or group that dared to question religious laws or doctrines.",
    des3: "What ultimately helped shift the balance was Europe’s exposure to other civilisations, notably that of China, which was then flourishing in a golden age. The curiosity of European authorities led them to explore Chinese civilisation in depth and gather extensive information about it. France and England, in particular, dispatched exploratory missions comprising Jesuits, scholars, and travellers.",
    des4: "This cultural and philosophical encounter with China played a pivotal role in undermining religious dogmas within Europe. Western thinkers discovered an ethical system that functioned independently of divine revelation, arousing the curiosity of many philosophers who began to study Confucianism and Taoism. These traditions impressed them by their lack of doctrinal dogma.",
    des5: "Confucius, in particular, was admired for having established a moral and social philosophy grounded in ethics rather than fear of divine punishment. He formulated a vision of good and evil based on human values, not metaphysical threats.",
    des6: "Confucius succeeded in replacing many terms derived from primitive religious vocabulary with purely ethical ones, creating a comprehensive moral code for social conduct. His philosophy focused on human beings and their service to one another, aspiring to elevate them towards the ideal of the 'superior man'. This intellectual shift played a significant role in loosening the hold of theological authority in Europe.",
    des7: "Some philosophers were so taken by Confucius that the German thinker Christian Wolff suggested he be counted among the saints, stating that Confucius had 'taught the people the principles of virtue five hundred years before the advent of Christianity.'",
    des8: "Chinese civilisation’s impact also extended to European literature and theatre. Chinese-themed plays appeared on the English stage, and Voltaire adapted a Chinese drama into his play The Chinese Orphan. In his Philosophical Dictionary, he described China as 'the most admirable of kingdoms—ancient, vast, populous, and the best governed.'",
    des9: "While this influence was evident in the realms of philosophy and literature, it was equally notable in the scientific sphere. Academic institutions played a complementary role in advancing thought, particularly with philosophers attaining strategic positions—such as Duclos—which allowed them to influence academic curricula.",
    des10:
      "Meanwhile, the emergence of salons and cafés as venues for debate marked the beginning of a cultural renaissance, nurturing the exchange of ideas and fostering intellectual growth. These developments significantly contributed to the rise of the press and the publication of scientific and literary journals, making knowledge accessible to the middle classes, not only the elite.",

      "If sectarianism constitutes the most acute form of psychological isolation among individuals and groups, it likewise represents the most advanced stage of intellectual sterility. The mind enclosed within the confines of sectarian identity is deprived of renewal and creativity. As Nietzsche once observed, “The inability to exchange our thoughts with others is the most dreadful form of solitude.” The sectarian, encircled by the narrow boundaries of dogma, paralyses his capacity for reason, stifling thought at its very inception.",
    des1: "Examining the social dynamics of so-called primitive societies reveals striking similarities with many modern communities that continue to engage with their surroundings in instinctive, unmediated ways. The intense attachment to the primary group once served as a survival mechanism: in early tribal contexts, individuals relied on the collective for protection and meaning. The paradox is that many sectarian minds today continue to function within that same psychological framework, despite the passage of time and the development of civilised societies. They perceive the world through the lens of their sect, as though their intellect had never emerged from the shadows of the ancestral cave.",
    des2: "It is often the case that humans seek to emulate mythical figures who embody the collective aspirations and self-image of their group. In many so-called primitive societies, we find legends centred on a heroic founder—be it a prophet, warrior, or imagined saviour. A vivid illustration of this can be found among the Onondaga tribe of Native Americans, who wove intricate myths around their legendary hero Hiawatha. Through tales of his miraculous birth and triumphs, the tribe projected its suppressed desires and collective psyche onto this imagined figure. Such characters are sanctified and transformed into symbols of communal identity, serving to legitimise a sense of superiority over external ‘others’. These dynamics are not unique; they are echoed in the veneration of saints and prophets across religious traditions. Humanity seems to require a symbolic mirror—a figure from one’s own race, lineage or creed—through which the self may be elevated, affirmed, and projected onto the world.",
    des3: "Over time, these mythologised identities become the foundations of sacred belief systems, producing rituals and obligations that bind the individual more tightly to the group. The more intensely one identifies with the sect or tribe, the more one internalises its strictures—until these constraints become self-imposed chains. In this condition, the individual creates within their psyche a false paradise, where forbidden desires are justified so long as they are directed at those who fall outside the group’s symbolic order.",
    des4: "The sectarian perspective reduces the world to binary oppositions: righteousness is confined to one's own group, while malevolence is invariably ascribed to others. This polarised worldview engenders a chronic sense of victimhood, feeding the fear that foreign influence will sully the imagined purity of the group. Consequently, any unfamiliar idea is rejected not due to its content, but because it originates from outside. As the old adage goes, “Man is an enemy to what he does not understand,” and so the sectarian becomes hostile to whatever he cannot categorise within his ideological system.",
    des5: "In this environment, the group's insularity is transformed into a defensive mechanism, eventually adopted by individuals as a psychological necessity. A mental barricade is erected, obscuring the real source of anxiety. Rather than confront the internal contradictions and existential discomforts arising from within, the sectarian mind attributes its unease to external forces. The primitive psyche is unable to distinguish between anxieties born of self and those arising from the world. These compounded fears are often displaced and refigured as a false sense of superiority over the other.",
    des6: "This is the very soil in which intellectual sterility grows. A mind that merely recycles inherited dogmas without reflection or innovation becomes barren—incapable of posing new questions or imagining alternative futures. Thought withers in such sterile ground, much like an exhausted field that can no longer yield fruit. The tragedy is that this intellectual inertia is frequently mistaken for loyalty to tradition or fidelity to identity. What appears as steadfastness is, in truth, the slow death of the creative spirit.",
    des7: "Comfort may be found in this enclosure, for it relieves the sectarian of the burden of existential uncertainty. Pre-packaged answers replace the trials of individual enquiry. The world becomes simplified, conveniently interpreted through a prefabricated lens that demands no critical engagement. Yet this comfort is illusory—more akin to the stagnation of still water than to true tranquillity. A mind that avoids contradiction, that suppresses questioning, is one destined for decay. Just as the body requires resistance and challenge to remain strong, so too does the intellect demand exposure to difference, to that which lies beyond the familiar.",
    des8: "HHistory is replete with examples of societies that have fallen into decline due to sectarian rigidity. A collective mind that refuses to engage with broader human experience is gradually reduced to a storehouse of obsolete customs and lifeless repetitions. In contrast, the vitality of civilisations has always been linked to the interplay of diverse perspectives. The flowering of knowledge has come from the cross-pollination of cultures, while the descent into ignorance has invariably followed the path of sectarian seclusion and ideological purity.",
    des9: "To break free from the stranglehold of sectarian thinking requires both personal bravery and a broader awakening. The sectarian must confront their fear of difference, embracing instead the discomfort of doubt and the liberating possibility of not knowing. Truth is never the sole property of one group or doctrine. When the mind is liberated from its confinement, it may roam freely in the wide-open fields of shared humanity. Such emancipation is not a betrayal of one’s roots, but rather a deepening of them—a way of enriching identity through dialogue and experience. As with trees, ideas cannot flourish in hardened soil; they need the air of freedom and the light of diversity in order to grow.",
    des10:
      "Ultimately, the sectarian mind remains inert so long as it orbits around a single axis. Intellectual sterility is not fate, but a condition borne of fear and enclosure. When the mind dares to tear down its walls and step into the unknown, it may rediscover its buried fertility. In doing so, the individual realises how much potential has been lost in the darkness of seclusion—and how quickly it may be restored by the illumination of universal thought.",

      "And thus we find that all primitive collectives tend to view other groups as inferior. This is evident in the example of certain Native American communities, who believed themselves to be “God’s chosen people,” just as some Indian tribes called themselves “the people beyond whom there are no other people.” This illusion of superiority does not emerge from authentic excellence, but rather from deep-seated insecurity—an identity so fragile that it must define itself by elevating one group above all others.",

      "Arab societies appear as immovable and unchanging entities—resistant to transformation, retreating into isolation, intolerant of the 'other', and unwilling to engage with difference. This results in a persistent tendency to draw nationalist distinctions, a division between 'us' and 'them'. Ironically, many Arab societies apply this same logic of exclusion and discrimination internally, turning it against their own people.",
    des1: "These societies are, in effect, in a coma. Their capacity for production and motion is paralysed—stifled by the repeated traumas of historical defeat over the past centuries. The collapse of certain political ideologies has only deepened this paralysis, giving rise instead to a form of religious and moral hysteria. Efforts to adapt to a new world order are being carried out with the same comatose mindset. One could say these societies are in a pre-conscious state, akin to a child attempting to outgrow infancy. It is at this very moment that old narratives of past glories and humiliations resurface and reassert themselves in the collective psyche. Rather than confronting the disappointments of history, these societies attempt to conceal them beneath the carpet of the unconscious.",
    des2: "To the outside world, they present a proud façade—a claim to moral and spiritual superiority. They convince themselves that they are a chosen people, destined for some long-lost glory. Their cultural identity is rooted in a sense of superiority and excessive pride in belonging, which has only deepened their isolation. While they frequently accuse others of racism, they seldom pause to examine their own prejudices or the intense animosity they harbour towards those who differ from them.",
    des3: "From a psychological perspective, and as a result of their successive defeats, many Arab societies remain gripped by a deep-seated inferiority complex—one that has been transfigured into a fantasy of lost victories. They remain perpetually defensive, ever ready to attack those who think or live differently. Cloaked in fear, they wage symbolic wars against others’ beliefs. Yet in their obsessive belligerence, they lose sight of their true aim: the elevation of the individual and the advancement of society towards a more humane and enlightened state.",
    des4: "This climate of fear leads to repression and the destruction of the individual. The same historical tragedies are endlessly repeated, buried deep within the collective memory, only to resurface again. These societies resemble a naïve soldier with a narrow field of vision—lacking the tools for constructive adaptation in a rapidly changing world. They lack a clear strategic vision, a coherent definition of priorities. As a result, they are consumed by confusion and inertia, which pushes them further into isolation. And the more isolated they become, the more reactive and uninformed their responses grow.",
    des5: "In such a context, the only remaining source of pride becomes religion. Societies begin reconstructing their laws and institutions around religious discourse, retreating into older ways of life and modes of thinking that are fundamentally out of step with the profound transformations shaping the modern world. This withdrawal is a key factor in the gradual disintegration of the social fabric. It leads to a kind of cultural and intellectual rot. The social body turns in on itself, enclosed within a narrow sphere, refusing to acknowledge any movement or innovation beyond its borders.",
    des6: "These societies now find themselves waging a war on two fronts: internally, to suppress any individual attempts at rebellion or reform; and externally, to assert their identity and beliefs in the face of other nations. But their narrow, pessimistic worldview deprives them of the internal peace and stability they might otherwise enjoy. They become caught in a cycle of self-inflicted oppression.",
    des7: "Though our societies have suffered repeated tragedies and calamities, they have failed to acquire the knowledge necessary to confront present-day challenges. The emergence of religions in the region—often romanticised under the misleading term “the Middle East”—did not help foster a culture of critical thought. Nor have the historical experiences of suffering and oppression taught any meaningful lessons. The absolute reliance on religion stems from an inability to analyse and interpret the world rationally. These societies entangle their misery and suffering with religious faith, turning ever more desperately towards a God who dominates their worldview and daily life. This, in turn, leads to the erosion of the individual self, with profound negative effects on collective behaviour.",
    des8: "The dynamic between the individual and the group becomes especially destructive. The group absorbs and overrides individual belief, while the individual is expected to renounce their uniqueness for the sake of collective conformity. Individual value is sacrificed at the altar of group identity. Individuals become willing to martyr themselves for the group’s ideals. In societies where laws and values are drawn from religion, religion itself becomes the ultimate objective—something to which every individual must aspire. With the collapse of Arab nationalism, many turned to religion to reconstruct their local identities. The resulting rise of fundamentalist and extremist movements—preaching jihad in the name of God—is a logical consequence of this failure.",

Yet it fails to grasp the imprints of its past—those inscribed within nature itself. Desperately, it turns to its stones, seeking to triumph over nature and assert itself as the pioneer. But it freezes each time it attempts to reach into the depths of its own self. Enraged, it unleashes its fury upon its own limbs, cursing the individual and surrendering to mythic fantasy. It declares wars between its parts, as each seeks to prove its superiority over the other.",
    des1: "Here is humankind: after creating a god for itself, it erected a barrier between its own awareness and its latent inner fuel. Thus emerged religions—to suppress the unconscious—and to draw their symbols from the collective unconscious. Each religion reflects the personality of its founder and his own repressed instincts. The founder projects his narcissism upon individuals and societies, transforming them into a herd obedient to him in the name of religion.",
    des2: "Man fashioned his deities and stripped them of their spiritual essence, rendering them instinctive collective needs. In doing so, the god becomes a contradiction—at odds with both its own nature and the very idea of its existence. No longer the beginning and the end, it is stripped of its spiritual symbolism and becomes instead a psychological truth for every fragile soul. Individuals arm themselves with the god in opposition to the collective, while the collective arms itself with the god against history, granting itself the right to endure and unleashing its instincts upon nature.",
    des3: "Religion emerged from a collective instinctual will—one that imprisons the individual within its cycle, unites the group, and gathers all unconscious drives into a single collective vessel that enslaves the individual, suppressing personal instinct. Thus, individuals melt into the group, and collective instincts are elevated into a god that imposes its desires upon them.",
    des4: "From the very beginning, man sought power. It began as physical strength, then evolved into an abstract notion of power. To possess it, man searched for its source—but failed to identify it. Its origin lies in nature. And because man, at a subconscious level, recognised the impossibility of mastering nature, he turned instead to imagined, supernatural creative forces.",
    des5: "We see how early humans attempted to merge energy with religious symbols—as demonstrated in ancient stone carvings. In Africa, thousands of years ago, the Kingdom of Wakanda referred to every mysterious or intangible force as Wakanda: the sun, the moon, the stars, thunder, wind, and the demons believed to inhabit the elements. As Maj-Ji described it: “Wakanda is an expression of mystery, power, the sacred, and eternity. It is both a cosmic and practical force.”",
    des6: "As humanity developed, so did this concept. The Sumerians were the first to lay the foundations of cosmic order. They created gods in their own image—endowed with human emotions and traits—yet granted them the immortality that man lacked. Their gods mirrored man in their surging emotions and overwhelming impulses.",
    des7: "With the creation of gods, myths and legends about the beginning of the universe arose. A striking resemblance can be found between the Babylonian Enuma Elish creation epic and the Book of Genesis. In the Enuma Elish, the serpent symbolised darkness, just as it did in Genesis. The Babylonian Atrahasis epic, which recounts the birth of humanity, states that humans were fashioned from clay and blood. Likewise, in the Sumerian text Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta, we read: “In those days, there were neither serpents nor scorpions, no lions, no hyenas, no savage dogs nor wolves. There was no fear, no terror. Man had no rival, no adversary. The land of Martu was safe and secure. The entire universe, and all people, glorified Enlil with one voice.”",
    des8: "Just as later humans would glorify God with one tongue. We also observe the resemblance between the creation of Eve in Genesis and the creation of Ninti—the Lady of the Rib—in another Sumerian myth.",
    des9: "The Sumerians did not neglect to create a myth of human rebellion against the gods, as seen in the tale of Isati Shuka Kituda, where the protagonist commits a fatal sin by seducing Inanna. The epics Atrahasis and Gilgamesh both depict the wrath of the gods, who unleashed a great flood as punishment for humankind. The Sumerians also conceived myths about demons, such as Asag, the demon of plagues, to explain the disasters and diseases that befell them.",
    des10:
      "To this day, man continues to seek victory over his fear—over the thick darkness that lurks within. But in doing so, he dons the mask of a god to conceal his impotence. What he did not realise at first is that the more tightly he clings to this god, the deeper his fear grows, and the more he senses defeat echoing through the fabric of his life.",

As a result, he rejects the psychological evolution that challenges him, depriving himself of the ability to be open to external ideas. In doing so, he cuts himself off from self-discovery and from becoming part of a greater whole.",
    des1: "This society resists progress; it also rejects the emancipation of the individual from the collective. It stands as a barrier to personal freedom, suppressing any attempt at rebellion or deviation. No matter how determined or persistent the effort, the drive for emancipation is consistently stifled. This suppression eventually manifests as a kind of psychological disturbance, disrupting the balance between the outward flow of thoughts and a retreat into the depths of imagination.",

Any dysfunction in this area inevitably has repercussions for humanity as a whole. Just as libido is the gravitational centre of the individual, so too is the individual the core of society. Any imbalance at the personal level is bound to reverberate throughout the collective.",

Herein lies the glaring contradiction that haunts the Arab citizen: the dissonance between practical realities and the fantasies that serve unconscious desires, all compounded by external pressures.",
    des5: "This persona replicates itself among individuals through the subconscious. As Jung observed, individual consciousness is the most elusive aspect of the self, defined by the unique traits of each person—traits that can differ widely. In contrast, the unconscious is a shared foundation that connects individuals to their people and their history.",

The mass becomes the one, and the one becomes the mass. Individuals are no longer unique contributors to a whole but rather replaceable fragments of it.",
    des8: "The Arab “mass” proves largely incapable of renewing its image, clinging instead to uniformity at all costs—leading ultimately to the repression of the self.

The Russia-hosted Syrian National Dialogue Congress in Sochi may pave the way to the resolution of the Syrian crisis, Randa Kassis, the leader of the “Astana platform” of the Syrian opposition, has told Sputnik, highlighting the necessity of the creation of the constitutional commission during the ongoing summit to facilitate the peace process.`,
    des2: `Those who have come to the Syrian National Dialogue Congress in the Russian resort city of Sochi are motivated by patriotism and responsibility for the future of their country, Randa Kassis, the leader of the “Astana platform” of the Syrian opposition, told Sputnik Arabic, slamming those who snubbed the summit.`,
    des3: `“Anyone who refused to participate in the Sochi congress is irresponsible,” the politician highlighted.`,
    des4: `According to Kassis, all the members of her delegation understand that the Syrian crisis could not be resolved under the aegis of the United States. The Syrians have to kick-start the process themselves, here, in Sochi, she stressed.`,
    des5: `
“We must continue to work despite numerous difficulties faced by the Syrian opposition,” the politician said. “We must do everything to ensure the success of the Sochi talks.”`,
    des6: `
Kassis underscored that President Vladimir Putin's initiative to hold the Syrian National Dialogue Congress in Sochi is an important step, which, unfortunately, was not accepted by some political figures.`,
    des7: `“If Vladimir Putin initiated something, it means not just the intention to do something, but the implementation of the objectives,” she pointed out. “Therefore, I pin my hopes on the event and this is why we arrived in Sochi.”`,
    des8: `
The politician emphasized that she had made efforts to gather as many representatives of the Syrian opposition as possible to form a working group. “We need to start finding the way out of the crisis immediately. I believe that it is impossible without the creation of a new constitution,” she noted.`,
    des9: `
Speaking to Sputnik, Kassis shed light on the Astana platform’s plans and program. The politician emphasized the necessity to create a “constitutional commission” within the framework of the negotiations.`,
    des10: `
“We need to start working on a new Syrian constitution,” she said. “We have prepared our own draft constitution, on which we have spent a year working on.”`,
    des11: `According to the politician one of the most important issues concerning the future Syrian constitution is the maintenance of a secular state: “To clarify this issue I offered the following [definition]: the secularism is defined by the state’s neutrality to religious or non-religious beliefs of a Syrian citizen,” she said, “Beliefs could be not only religious, it could be views or a position and a person should have freedom [to express them].”`,
    des12: `
The present Syrian constitution offers four options to define a Syrian citizen’s religious beliefs: Sunni Muslim, Druze, Orthodox or Catholic Christian. Kassis explained that for ordinary Syrians the matters of marriages and inheritance are closely connected with their religious beliefs and existing state laws.
`,
    des13: `
She noted that “in order to overcome the potential difficulties” she proposes “to introduce the fifth category — “a Syrian citizen” — without any religious references.`,
    des14: `“It is necessary to give the Syrians the freedom of choice. A person may prefer to live in an exclusively secular legal field,” Kassis suggested.`,
    des15: `On January 30 the Syrian national dialogue congress officially opened in Sochi. The summit has brought together various opposition and pro-governmental forces, as well as representatives of the country’s numerous ethnic and religious groups in order to facilitate the peace process with the focus on the Syrian constitution and elections.`,
    des16: `
The UN Security Council permanent members as well as Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Lebanon and Saudi Arabia were also invited to participate in the event as observers. However, a number of states including the US and France, refused to attend, as did the Syrian Negotiation Commission (SNC) opposition group.`,

    des7: "I charged toward one of the boys, grabbed a stone larger than the ones they had thrown, and raised it high. For a brief second, I hesitated. Did I truly intend to strike? Or was it enough that they believed I would? I will never know the answer. What I do know is that in that moment, the balance of power changed. I saw fear flicker in their eyes, and with it, I understood something fundamental: power is an illusion, sustained only by submission. I had refused to submit.",
    des8: `That moment did not just shape how others saw me; it shaped how I saw myself. It changed my place in that school. The girls, who had once been passive observers, now looked to me for protection. The boys, who had sought to put me in my place, now knew I would not be tamed. But beyond that, something deeper had taken root in me. I understood, in a visceral way, that authority—whether in the form of a schoolyard bully or a greater system—was only as strong as our willingness to accept it. That lesson stayed with me. Over time, I distanced myself from all girls who had once followed the script written for them. I questioned religion, society, morality—every structure that sought to define my existence. My father, an agnostic, had instilled in me the value of independent thought, and I took that lesson to its extreme. I rejected all imposed beliefs, seeing them as viruses infecting human minds. My disdain for authority extended beyond the personal to the political, and my involvement in Syria’s revolution was not just a political stance—it was an extension of who I had become.`,

    des4: "When I returned to Syria at 12,I rebelled against everyone—authority, the police, and especially the political system. I refused to be enrolled in the Shabiba (Ba’ath Youth), rejecting the indoctrination and slogans forced upon students. I never accepted to be just a number in this country, a cog in the system that dictated how we should think, act, and exist.",
    des5: "Since the age of fourteen, I had engaged my friends in Damascus in debates over the existence of God. Back then, no one dared question religion or the notion of a creator. They labelled me a heretic, believingthat me disregard for social and political order was a direct result ofmy rejection of both God and authority.",

    des6: "At fifteen, my rebellion deepened. I made acquaintances with French employees at the French Cultural Center, where I found an intellectual and cultural connection that was absent amongmy own friends. At the same time, I traveled across Syria with friends my age, engaging in endless debates about God, religions, and the taboos that society tried to impose on us.",

I was passionate about causes, about ideas, about possibilities, but I also saw the futility in human existence. I oscillated between engagement and nihilism, between building something new and accepting that nothing truly lasts.

My work was raw, unfiltered, unapologetic. From the very beginning, my art was a form of resistance, a means to challenge the world as I saw it, to reject the suffocating conventions that sought to dictate how a woman, a body, or an artist should be perceived.",
    des8: `The female form has always been central to my work, but not in the way it’s been commodified for centuries. I refused to depicted it as a passive object of beauty or desire. To me, the body is a battlefield—a paradox, both a prison and a tool of liberation. My brushstrokes were never meant to comfort; they were meant to provoke, to unearth something unsettling, something that forces the viewer to confront their own gaze, their own biases.`,
    des9: `I never cared for perfect symmetry or predictable aesthetics. I paint to merge chaos with structure, to blend dream and reality until the line between them collapses. My canvases don’t tell linear stories—they vibrate, they pulse with contradictions. Critics have said my work feels like music—that it carries its own rhythm. I like that idea. Because art, for me, has always been about breaking silence, shattering complacency.`,
    des10: `I’ve exhibited my work in different places, seen people stare, question, sometimes even recoil. And I embrace that. Art should be unsettling. It should gnaw at something inside you, push you to see beyond the surface. `,

    description: `Sputnik          30/1/2018

The Russia-hosted Syrian National Dialogue Congress in Sochi may pave the way to the resolution of the Syrian crisis, Randa Kassis, the leader of the “Astana platform” of the Syrian opposition, has told Sputnik, highlighting the necessity of the creation of the constitutional commission during the ongoing summit to facilitate the peace process.

Those who have come to the Syrian National Dialogue Congress in the Russian resort city of Sochi are motivated by patriotism and responsibility for the future of their country, Randa Kassis, the leader of the “Astana platform” of the Syrian opposition, told Sputnik Arabic, slamming those who snubbed the summit.

“Anyone who refused to participate in the Sochi congress is irresponsible,” the politician highlighted.

According to Kassis, all the members of her delegation understand that the Syrian crisis could not be resolved under the aegis of the United States. The Syrians have to kick-start the process themselves, here, in Sochi, she stressed.

“We must continue to work despite numerous difficulties faced by the Syrian opposition,” the politician said. “We must do everything to ensure the success of the Sochi talks.”

Kassis underscored that President Vladimir Putin’s initiative to hold the Syrian National Dialogue Congress in Sochi is an important step, which, unfortunately, was not accepted by some political figures.
“If Vladimir Putin initiated something, it means not just the intention to do something, but the implementation of the objectives,” she pointed out. “Therefore, I pin my hopes on the event and this is why we arrived in Sochi.”

The politician emphasized that she had made efforts to gather as many representatives of the Syrian opposition as possible to form a working group. “We need to start finding the way out of the crisis immediately. I believe that it is impossible without the creation of a new constitution,” she noted.

Speaking to Sputnik, Kassis shed light on the Astana platform’s plans and program. The politician emphasized the necessity to create a “constitutional commission” within the framework of the negotiations.

“We need to start working on a new Syrian constitution,” she said. “We have prepared our own draft constitution, on which we have spent a year working on.”

According to the politician one of the most important issues concerning the future Syrian constitution is the maintenance of a secular state: “To clarify this issue I offered the following [definition]: the secularism is defined by the state’s neutrality to religious or non-religious beliefs of a Syrian citizen,” she said, “Beliefs could be not only religious, it could be views or a position and a person should have freedom [to express them].”
The present Syrian constitution offers four options to define a Syrian citizen’s religious beliefs: Sunni Muslim, Druze, Orthodox or Catholic Christian. Kassis explained that for ordinary Syrians the matters of marriages and inheritance are closely connected with their religious beliefs and existing state laws.

She noted that “in order to overcome the potential difficulties” she proposes “to introduce the fifth category — “a Syrian citizen” — without any religious references.

“It is necessary to give the Syrians the freedom of choice. A person may prefer to live in an exclusively secular legal field,” Kassis suggested.

On January 30 the Syrian national dialogue congress officially opened in Sochi. The summit has brought together various opposition and pro-governmental forces, as well as representatives of the country’s numerous ethnic and religious groups in order to facilitate the peace process with the focus on the Syrian constitution and elections.

The UN Security Council permanent members as well as Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Lebanon and Saudi Arabia were also invited to participate in the event as observers. However, a number of states including the US and France, refused to attend, as did the Syrian Negotiation Commission (SNC) opposition group.

Speakers will reflect on how they have personally overcome the challenges of communication in their involvements in peacebuilding, communications, peace negotiations, as well as discussions with perpetrators of violence and underrepresented groups to build lasting peace.

Coming from violent and divided environments as well as backgrounds in science, art, business, and more, speakers will share their personal stories of peace and how communication has made a difference in their peacebuilding efforts.

The Geneva Peace Talks are a public event organized on the occasion of the International Day of Peace in a partnership between the United Nations Office at Geneva, Interpeace and the Geneva Peacebuilding Platform.`,

    description: `The relationship between law and religion is an actual and thorny problem, especially in the light of the development, in the Euro-Mediterranean area, of multiple ethical and religious feelings which have generated more and more complex and elaborate, as a result of the relevant migratory flows characterizing the present articulated relations. All this is the result of the relevant migrations which characterize the present situation.

The debate over the space to acknowledge juridical expectations deriving from the encounter/confrontation of different religions and cultures regards, among other issues, international, constitutional, regional and maritime laws.

Starting from theoretical, philosophical and legal considerations, this workshop aims at analyzing the links between the religious and juridical aspects of Mediterranean and European States.

The first session will examine the connection between religion and law in the light of the revolutions in North-African countries, with a special attention to gender and childhood rights.

The second session will be instead dedicated to the analysis of the concepts of pluralism and freedom of worship in the context of European public space, with a special attention to the experiences of several Euro-Mediterranean States, Italy among them.`,
