        des1: "As the crescendo of Ride of the Valkyries echoed and ground forces began advancing into Ukraine\u2014amid Western condemnation and threats of economic and military sanctions aimed at isolating Russia\u2014the West hoisted the banner of \u201cpride and resistance.\u201d",
        des2: "Zelensky appealed to Europe and the United States for unequivocal support, believing\u2014or perhaps merely hoping\u2014that America, in particular, would come to his rescue.",
        des3: "The Ukrainian president is not alone in regarding the United States as the ultimate guardian and sleepless sentinel, watching over its \u201cflock\u201d with unwavering vigilance. In this worldview, democracy is under its guardianship, and justice is its responsibility. This perspective is not exclusive to him; many across the globe share this vision. Just as some assume America\u2019s superiority, others see it as the enemy of peoples and nations\u2014a hegemonic power orchestrating conspiracies to dismantle governments that oppose its interests.",
        des4: "There is no denying that America\u2019s \u201cfailed\u201d wars and \u201cuninspired\u201d strategies\u2014draped in the rhetoric of moral intervention and bent on exporting a simplistic democratic model without regard for the complexities of culture\u2014have entrenched binary thinking. This dualism, the backbone of many cultures, offers a shallow and convenient answer for those unwilling to confront the layered nature of human societies. Thus, America becomes either an ally or an enemy\u2014nothing in between.",
        des5: "Hollywood\u2019s industrial-scale film production has only deepened this image, recasting the United States as a mythic hero in the imagination of some\u2014particularly those desperate to escape harsh realities. And so, reality blurs with longing, giving rise to the romanticism of the powerless.",
        des6: "This idea of American supremacy is not confined to those chasing the illusion of the \u201cAmerican dream\u201d; it extends equally to those who see the United States as a malevolent force, intent on crushing the aspirations of nations. Both sides, in their own way, reinforce the notion of a unipolar world, ignoring the emergence of other political, economic, and military powers\u2014and denying the reality of a multipolar global order.",
        des7: "The individual has long since surrendered to the notion of guardianship. In many societies, from birth, one falls under the authority of one\u2019s parents, only to be subsumed later by society, and then by the state. It is no surprise, then, that one ends up chasing the mirage of a modern-day \u201chero\u201d\u2014a figure shaped by fantasies and longings\u2014only to fall prey to propaganda.",
        des8: "This propaganda is by no means exclusive to the United States, but I highlight it here because of its vast cinematic machinery, which has fuelled its rise and prolonged its tiresome narrative\u2014one that no longer captures the imagination of any but the na\u00efve.",
        des9: "Many individuals and groups continue to suffer from binary thinking\u2014a legacy inherited from Plato, who equated justice with the health of the soul, and injustice with its illness. He laid the foundations of this dualistic framework, dividing the world into pairs: good and evil, justice and injustice, war and famine, health and disease, chaos and order, and so on.",
        des10: "Later philosophical traditions moved towards more pluralistic understandings, recognising the complex and multi-faceted nature of human psychology. Yet, even today, many cultures still rely heavily on binaries. Within them, the individual often retreats to a \u201cparadise\u201d of romantic elements\u2014constructs of imagined perfection.",
        des11: "For many, this paradise represents a sustained emotional or physical state, free of pain or injustice\u2014a realm of perpetual fairness, happiness, and tranquillity. And although some societies have managed to break free from the oppressive triad of power, granting broader rights to individuals and ensuring a greater degree of equality before the law, binary thinking still dominates. It prevails even among those engaged in public affairs.",
        des12: "It is clear that the implementation of justice in its \u201cfantastical\u201d sense remains, to this day, an impossibility\u2014incapable of aligning with the intricate nature of human behaviour, or of adapting to the multiplicity of cultures, political dynamics, military conflicts, or personal struggles. Binary thinking, then, is nothing more than a form of na\u00efve romanticism\u2014a delusion that many still insist on maintaining.",
        des13: "A brief glance at human history reveals a landscape riddled with conflict and primitive behaviours\u2014those which surface in times of war, famine, or existential threat.",
        des14: "From this, we can conclude that romantic idealism is an artificial construct\u2014alien to our nature. Humans do not inhabit a planet filled with cartoonish characters. Life is not a tidy dichotomy of good and evil, justice and injustice, peace and war, right and wrong. Rather, it is a complex entanglement of all these elements\u2014alongside countless others\u2014working together, however chaotically, in service of continuity."

        description: "an article critiquing performative empathy and emotional sensationalism in modern digital and media cultures.",
        des1: "Over the past decade \u2014 ever since social media infiltrated nearly every home, bar, and street corner \u2014 we\u2019ve seen a surge in words and phrases (regardless of their linguistic merit or expressive depth), freely offered by their creators and generously rewarded by followers and online friends with medals of \u201chumanity.\u201d These medals, of course, are nothing more than symbolic gestures \u2014 emojis, empty phrases, and at best, dotless, hollow expressions.",
        des2: "Social networks have constructed a new social order \u2014 one partly driven by collective emotional exaggeration \u2014 giving rise to grand gestures, noble declarations, and what are touted as elevated \u201chuman values.\u201d But the foundation of these values lies in fantasy: a kind of escapist illusion that feeds an inflated \u201cgreat ego.\u201d And that ego is easily gratified \u2014 after all, such values demand no more than a few clich\u00e9d words or symbols.",
        des3: "We saw this flood of \u201chumanity\u201d in recent days with the tragic story of the Moroccan child, Rayan. No one denies the pain of the incident, especially for his family. But what invites reflection is the scale of the media coverage (I stress the word \u201cscale\u201d \u2014 we now live in an age of grand words, grand values, grand emotions), and the sweeping emotional response. It was, yet again, a race \u2014 a race to display the softest, most refined expressions of \u201chumanity,\u201d where individuals competed to earn the honorary badge of \u201ccivilisation.\u201d",
        des4: "Rayan died, and all of \u201chumanity\u201d mourned \u2014 wiping its tears, raising its hands in prayer, drained by its collective emotional labour. The child died, and \u201chumanity\u201d once more slipped into a coma, briefly awakened by his cries before returning to sleep.",
        des5: "And so, other children might rightly wonder what this \u201chumanity\u201d means for them \u2014 especially those whose deaths go unnoticed, perhaps because they perish in groups rather than as individuals. Children in Syria, Yemen, Libya, Iraq \u2014 dying in droves from hunger, cold, disease \u2014 do not qualify for such coverage. They are no longer \u201cnewsworthy.\u201d Nor are African children, some killed by tragic incidents \u2014 trampled by a hippo, or simply by poverty and lack of basic necessities. They, too, have become \u201cold stories.\u201d",
        des6: "None of these children can hope to inspire the kind of noble, global sentiment we recently witnessed. Because \u201chumanity,\u201d as it now functions, requires emotionally charged, individual stories. It cannot survive constant exposure to systemic suffering. To avoid emotional collapse, it must ration its sympathy.",
        des7: "So \u201chumanity,\u201d in its need for self-preservation, reveals itself in herd-like behaviour \u2014 crossing borders, fuelled by sensory globalisation. It performs empathy on demand.",
        des8: "And it\u2019s not only individuals. Television networks, too, compete: who can add the most pathos to the script? Which presenter can cry more believably, perform the most heartfelt gesture? Who can win the title of Most Human? It would not be surprising to one day see a televised contest called \u201cWho Will Win Humanity?\u201d",
        des9: "This race is pushing many rational individuals \u2014 those who respond thoughtfully and without affectation to tragedy \u2014 either into silence or into mimicking the herd, out of fear they\u2019ll be labelled \u201cinhuman.\u201d",
        des10: "Such uniform emotional reactions \u2014 disconnected from nature and blind to human diversity \u2014 ultimately pave the way for media authoritarianism. This, in turn, dulls the viewer\u2019s ability to feel and think. I do not exaggerate when I say that one-dimensional media can manufacture emotionally impaired human templates \u2014 models of \u201cideal\u201d selective compassion. We end up with a strange creature: a human being whose values and meanings are utterly confused.",
        des11: "This is not the first, nor will it be the last, tragic incident of its kind. Life overflows with daily personal catastrophes \u2014 and their coverage, if any, should be the responsibility of local media, nothing more.",
        des12: "A person who is truly conscious of life and death does not need to follow the crowd, nor become an echo, simply to prove they care. The amplified, theatrical emotions we now witness \u2014 steeped in hypocrisy and herd instinct \u2014 are no proof of anything. They reflect only a deep inability to generate change or to carve out new paths for humanity. They offer nothing more than melodrama, performed before a stone.",
        des13: "For years now, we\u2019ve heard endless talk of \u201cnew\u201d human values \u2014 limitless, borderless, all-embracing. Yet we remain caught in the same cycle of emojis, hashtags, and body language. Real values are not acrobatic displays, tearful theatrics, or reactive posturing. They are a form of sustained awareness \u2014 one that is neither fragmented nor conditioned by context."

      description: "an article discussing the illusion of democracy and political movements in the Middle East, comparing them with historical examples.",
      des1: "Many mistakenly believe that tyranny is confined to autocratic rulers. In truth, it often conceals itself beneath the guise of reform and piety, preying on a population’s yearning for change. From Renaissance Florence to the modern Middle East, the syndrome recurs — the faces change, but the structures of deception remain eerily familiar.",
      des2: "In the late fifteenth century, Girolamo Savonarola captivated a significant portion of Florence’s population with his fervent sermons and alignment with the poor and disenfranchised. Promising a people’s republic, he presented himself as a righteous preacher, condemning Rome and the Pope — whom he saw as the very embodiment of corruption.",
      des3: "Savonarola’s rejection of art, poetry, and philosophy — which he deemed distractions from divine devotion — resonated with many, not only among the masses, but also among the opponents of Lorenzo the Magnificent, the famed patron of the arts under whose reign Florence flourished artistically, commercially, and architecturally.",
      des4: "Two years after Lorenzo’s death, and following the flight of his son Piero during the French invasion of 1494, Savonarola managed to negotiate with King Charles VIII of France, securing the right for Florentines to choose their own government — a right previously reserved for a select elite.",
      des5: "Though this shift appeared democratic on the surface, in reality it ushered in a theocratic rule under Savonarola’s iron grip. His reign, known as the “years of darkness”, saw the burning of books, the destruction of Botticelli’s paintings, and even the smashing of Michelangelo’s sculptures.",
      des6: "It is difficult not to draw parallels between Savonarola’s Florence — seduced by the illusion of democracy — and our own societies, which embraced revolutionary slogans without questioning the cultural foundations upon which real change must be built.",
      des7: "In more recent times, particularly following the uprisings across parts of the Middle East and North Africa, we witnessed a surge in political dissidents and human rights activists. Yet their conception of rights remained conditional, filtered through the lens of their own inherited cultural values.",
      des8: "They called for political freedom without first understanding its essence, or freeing it from the cultural strictures that constrain individual autonomy. In this, they differed little from the rulers they opposed — figures who, despite their lack of vision or competence, clung to power not through merit, but through inertia and the absence of alternatives.",
      des9: "Many of these rulers evoke the image of medieval monarchs. Take, for instance, Louis XI of France, who imprisoned his adversaries in narrow cages — a precursor to modern methods of repression, perfected by successors who crammed hundreds into cells scarcely four square metres in size.",
      des10: "Nor is Charles VI — the so-called “mad king” — so far removed; the traits are disturbingly familiar.",
      des11: "As for today’s activists and self-styled defenders of liberty and democracy, one finds more than a faint echo of Savonarola’s moral absolutism. The difference lies only in their diminished eloquence and inability to rally the masses.",
      des12: "The so-called Arab Spring allowed many to purge their long-repressed frustrations, and transformed some into vocal opponents of authoritarianism. But their slogans, however legitimate in content, were devoid of cultural introspection.",
      des13: "We cannot democratise governance without first anchoring the rights of the individual — the right to express oneself freely and to live authentically, unburdened by traditional formulas such as “customs”, “tradition”, or “the forbidden”.",
      des14: "This is why so many activists and opposition figures, for over a decade now, continue to recite the same mantras about democracy and human rights, without ever working to chart a path towards them.",
      des15: "Subconsciously, they parrot these phrases not out of principle, but to mask their intellectual impotence — their inability to conceive of genuine frameworks for change.",
      des16: "It is this confusion — this lack of conceptual clarity — that leads to what I call the Parrot Syndrome.",
      des17: "In functioning democracies, activist movements are often capable of generating public debate, pressuring political actors to engage with emerging demands. Whether related to the environment, animal welfare, or individual freedoms, such movements are often the very expression of ongoing cultural and social transformation.",
      des18: "But such shifts cannot occur without first emancipating the imagination — liberating the individual from inherited taboos and disabling fixations that suffocate human potential.",
      des19: "We must also distinguish between the role of the activist and that of the politician or political dissident.",
      des20: "The activist’s role is to spotlight barriers to transformation, to awaken collective consciousness, and to galvanise groups into action — so that change becomes a political necessity embraced by parties or institutions.",
      des21: "Sadly, this distinction is rarely observed in our region. Both activists and dissidents tend to repeat the same empty slogans, mechanically and uncritically — parroting them with no real strategy for change.",
      des22: "Worse still, some Western governments encourage this sterile performance, failing to distinguish between those with genuine capability and those who merely imitate.",
      des23: "Yet we are not bound by this dilemma, nor by these two dismal archetypes.",
      des24: "We possess many pathways — and many tools — for real, substantive change: the kind that leads to the democratisation of meaning, of culture, and of society at large.",
      des25: "But this can only be achieved by conscious individuals.",

      description: "An opinion article analyzing Turkey's military intervention in Syria following the U.S. troop withdrawal, highlighting geopolitical, humanitarian, and institutional implications.",
      des1: "The decision to withdraw US forces from northeastern Syria was both hasty and profoundly misguided—a strategic blunder that effectively eliminated any prospect of peace in an already fragmented country.",
      des2: "President Trump’s reckless move handed the region over to the Turks, who wasted no time launching their offensive, killing and displacing innocent civilians in the process. We are now witnessing the early stages of a deliberate plan to alter the demographic fabric of the region.",
      des3: "It is nothing short of disgraceful that some Syrians have chosen to side with Turkish aggression—some even celebrating this military operation that endangers the lives of Syrians of all backgrounds: Kurds, Assyrians, Arabs, and Yazidis alike. Worse still, this incursion may pave the way for a resurgence of ISIS. It is pure fantasy to imagine, even for a moment, that the Turkish government is capable of managing or containing 118,000 detainees—fighters and their families—even if one were naïve enough to believe in Ankara’s goodwill.",
      des4: "In reality, these human time bombs are set to become bargaining chips in Turkey’s hands—deployed at will as leverage against any state that dares oppose its policies. Beyond that, Turkey will likely unleash these jihadists to complete its dirty work: assassinating members of the Autonomous Administration and sowing further instability across the region.",
      des5: "President Erdoğan still clings to the delusion of becoming a leader of the Islamist world—a modern-day caliph. We see this clearly in his determination to establish extremist institutions across northern Syria, particularly in areas under Turkish military occupation and the control of its Syrian proxies.",
      des6: "Against this grim backdrop, the United Nations chases the mirage of a “constitutional committee”, while doing nothing to condemn Turkey’s blatant aggression on Syrian soil. But one should hardly be surprised by such inaction from a tired, antiquated institution that repeatedly demonstrates its inability to respond meaningfully to global crises. The UN has become little more than a revolving door for incompetent politicians and diplomats whom their governments are eager to discard.",
      des7: "Since the appointment of Geir Pedersen—whom I had thought could not possibly fare worse than his predecessor, Staffan de Mistura—it has become painfully clear that we have yet to hit rock bottom. Rather than act with urgency or vision, the new envoy confined himself for nearly a year to engaging with opposition figures, most of whom are beholden to belligerent Turkey. This alone reveals both his naivety and his failure to craft fresh approaches to an increasingly complex conflict.",
      des8: "What hope is there when a UN envoy seeks to build trust between a deranged regime and a fragmented opposition bankrolled by agents of destruction?",
      des9: "And what can one reasonably expect from António Guterres—the current UN Secretary-General—who previously failed spectacularly in resolving the Cyprus conflict during his tenure as special envoy?",
      des10: "In a final, bitter irony, the long-delayed constitutional committee—after one year and seven months of repeated stillbirths—was finally brought into being, malformed and impotent, just days before Turkey launched its assault. And one of the guarantors of this very committee is a state actively working to carve up and annex Syrian territory under the cynical banner of “Operation Peace Spring”—more truthfully named the Fountain of Death and Destruction."

      description: "A critical examination of the impact of the Arab Spring on women’s rights in the MENA region, especially Syria, and the role of secularism in the quest for gender equality.",
      des1: "The recent wave of protests across several Arab countries raised significant hopes among women. These mass movements were, at the time, seen as the dawn of a new awareness, with the ultimate aim of achieving change. This period was preceded by a surge in secular and anti-religious movements, particularly in the virtual sphere, expressing a clear desire for substantial reforms. The goal of these secularists was to establish a democracy rooted in individual rights, allowing people at last to speak freely. Women were deeply involved in these secular movements, both prior to and during the emergence of the Arab Spring. Naturally, they hoped to lay the groundwork for gender equality and to bring an end to all forms of discrimination.",
      des2: "Contrary to these aspirations, the Arab Spring gave rise to radical Islamism, grounded in a literal interpretation of certain violent verses from the Qur’an—verses that reflect a deep-seated contempt for women, manifesting in misogynistic attitudes and discriminatory jurisprudence. While this “Spring” succeeded in toppling a few Arab dictators, it has, in many cases, replaced authoritarianism with a new form of tyranny: religious despotism. With the return of theocratic governance, women were among the first to suffer. Indeed, their situation has worsened in several Arab Spring countries, despite their active role in opposing authoritarian regimes and challenging social taboos.",
      des3: "Paradoxically, women’s rights have regressed following the uprisings in the MENA region (Middle East and North Africa). In many of these countries, women have become primary targets of violence—be it physical, social, or economic. Nonetheless, the outcomes vary widely depending on the circumstances and diversity of each nation.",
      des4: "Take Syria, for instance: women’s status varies significantly depending on their social, religious, or ethnic background. Syrian society is highly heterogeneous, and Common Law differs from one community to another. Four distinct personal status codes exist, pertaining to Catholic, Orthodox, Druze, and Sunni communities. For Sunnis, the code is based on Islamic Sharia. Although the Syrian Constitution proclaims secularity and freedom of worship, it also stipulates in Article 3 that the President of the Republic must be Muslim. Moreover, while the Constitution affirms gender equality in the workplace—promoting women’s financial independence—it still contains discriminatory provisions, including penal codes that legally justify so-called “honour crimes”.",
      des5: "Since the uprising of 2011, many women have fallen victim to rape—by both regime forces and rebel factions. The situation has further deteriorated, particularly in areas under Islamist rebel control. In territories held by the Islamic State, women accused of adultery have been stoned to death, and many are now confined to their homes by fear and force.",
      des6: "It is important to emphasise that other Islamist rebel groups also promote a rigid and restrictive interpretation of Islam, pushing to impose backward ideologies that obstruct women’s liberation.",
      des7: "There is, however, a glimmer of hope in Syria. This can be seen in the Kurdish-held regions, where a secular and egalitarian model has been implemented. The self-administered Kurdish authorities have adopted a system that rejects all forms of discrimination against women, establishing legal and social equality between the sexes. In these areas, Kurdish women hold around forty percent of local council seats, and female fighters play a prominent role on the front lines against a barbaric enemy.",
      des8: "In conclusion, it is clear that in societies shaped by religion and entrenched taboos, women are deprived of meaningful emancipation. The prevailing culture in many Arab-Muslim societies is one that enslaves the individual, with women as its primary victims.",
      des9: "The Islamisation of these societies, and the rise to power of Islamist forces in certain states, have rendered women the principal losers. They face patriarchal injustices drawn from Qur’anic verses that give men superiority in legal rights and inheritance.",
      des10: "In the twenty-first century, the condition of Arab-Muslim women has deteriorated to the point where they are reduced to a reproductive function. This generates profound frustration, particularly as these same women, through access to information and social networks, are exposed to more emancipated models. The sense of revolt that this stirs is understandable.",
      des11: "Syrian women, however, have a unique opportunity. They can align themselves with the minorities—making up thirty-five percent of the population—who favour secularism. This remains the only path toward enshrining a Common Law based on the principles of equality and parity between women and men.",
      des12: "In the face of the Islamic State’s barbarism, Muslim women have nothing to lose. They must adopt a critical mindset. They must question their belief system. They must scrutinise their adherence to a rigid, literalist interpretation of Islam. In this struggle, it is time for them—alongside enlightened men—to embark on the path towards secularism."

      description: "An analysis of Turkey's stance during the fight against ISIS and its role as an ally in NATO.",
      des1: "To combat the Islamic State (IS)—that totalitarian monstrosity intent on subjugating the Middle East and, ultimately, the world—ten regional powers signed the 'Jeddah Communiqué,' pledging to support President Barack Obama’s campaign against IS. But one key signature was missing: that of Turkey under President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.",
      des2: "When US Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel attempted to persuade Turkey to join the international coalition, Ankara flatly refused. In doing so, it disrupted the core of Atlantic solidarity. Not only did Turkey decline to participate militarily, but it also prohibited American and NATO aircraft—those best placed to reach Iraq—from taking off from its airbases.",
      des3: "Let us recall: the Turkish air force is equipped with cutting-edge American military technology, its pilots are trained by the United States, and Turkey hosts 24 NATO bases. Until 20 September, Erdoğan’s official justification was the fate of 46 Turkish hostages captured by IS in Mosul in July. We now know they were released in exchange for Turkish assistance to jihadist forces fighting Kurds in Syria.",
      des4: "This hostage narrative concealed a far more troubling reality—one utterly incompatible with the values of an 'ally' that claims to oppose terrorism, seeks EU membership, and remains a pillar of NATO. Erdoğan’s Turkey has actively supported Islamist terrorist groups in both Syria and Iraq, including IS, which counts over 1,000 Turkish nationals among its ranks.",
      des5: "Since the outbreak of the Syrian civil war, Ankara has turned a blind eye to IS training camps on Syrian soil and has facilitated the flow of weapons and jihadists through its territory. These fighters, hailing from across the globe, pass freely through Turkey en route to the battlefields of Syria and Iraq. Many are recruited openly, in mosques, schools, and even among Turkey’s security services.",
      des6: "The Turkish government’s support for IS has been openly denounced by the opposition (notably the Republican People’s Party, CHP), which laments that their nation has become a sanctuary for jihadists. One such group, the powerful Naqshbandi Islamist Brotherhood, maintains close ties with Erdoğan’s ruling AKP.",
      des7: "Does the neo-Sultan in Ankara loathe the Alawite Bashar al-Assad more than he fears IS? Or is he aligning himself with jihadists—who, like him, are nostalgic for the Caliphate—against the secular Alawite Syrians, just as he politically opposes their Alevi cousins in Turkey, whom he equally deems 'infidels'?",
      des8: "In recent weeks, Turkey has behaved more like an ally of IS than a NATO partner. It stood by as Kurdish forces in Syria—under-equipped and under-supported—faced IS onslaughts, notably in Kobane. Turkish tanks and heavy weaponry reportedly fell into the hands of IS fighters. Moreover, Turkey has refused to curb the smuggling of hydrocarbons from fields and refineries controlled by IS in Iraq and Syria, a trade that generates an estimated $2 million daily for the group.",
      des9: "Erdogan’s ambiguous and complicit role can no longer be denied.",
      des10: "The United States and NATO, ever quick to condemn Russia over Iran or Ukraine, must show equal resolve in confronting a supposed ally that flouts every norm of Western solidarity. As a prominent NATO member, Turkey cannot plead neutrality.",
      des11: "Faced with a threat as grave as IS—arguably the most dangerous enemy of democracy since the Third Reich and the USSR—Erdoğan and his Prime Minister, Ahmet Davutoğlu, architects of the 'neo-Ottoman' vision, must take a clear stand: either Turkey remains within the Alliance and commits fully to the coalition against IS, ceasing all material support to jihadists, or it must face the consequences of acting as an accomplice to Islamist barbarity.",
      des12: "Likewise, NATO must finally adopt a consistent stance. Since 1974, the Alliance has tolerated Turkey’s occupation of 37% of Cyprus—an EU member state—as well as its continuous violations of Greek airspace, especially over the Aegean. It can no longer turn a blind eye to Ankara’s overt support for jihadist forces, a fact even the staunchest Kemalists condemn.",
      des13: "France, which rejoined NATO’s Integrated Command in 2009 after its withdrawal in 1966 under General de Gaulle, must take a stand. If Turkey refuses to clarify its position, should we continue to tolerate Erdoğan’s duplicitous machinations?",

     screens: "Al-Hiwar al-Mutamaddin",
     description: "An exploration of the Arab Spring, its complex origins, and the impact of repression and extremism on the region's political dynamics.",
     des1: "What came to be known as the 'Arab Spring' – as many prefer to call it – was the result of a complex accumulation of factors over decades. This reinforces the belief that it was not a spontaneous eruption but rather the outcome of psychological and social tensions, intensified by external stimuli that compelled millions to release their repressed internal frustrations. This release began gradually, eventually evolving into revolutions that toppled entrenched regimes plagued by corruption and authoritarianism.",
     des2: "Excessive repression by authoritarian regimes played a decisive role in activating the collective unconscious, which instinctively sought outlets to release the growing pressure, especially under the constraints on freedom of expression. In a bid to maintain power, some regimes in Arab-Islamic societies employed a calculated strategy by instrumentalising fundamentalist religion. They played a double game—on one hand, feigning secularism by attacking religious-based political parties, while on the other, fuelling extremism and undermining individual awareness.",
     des3: "The religious foundation of Arab societies, which often restricts individuals within a value system at odds with human psychological needs, made it easier for these regimes to dominate. Religion, rather than acting as a source of transcendence, became a refuge for those escaping their own realities and a world that denied their essential needs. This fusion of religion and authoritarian rule eroded national identity, particularly given that religion is inherently transnational, and religiosity does not necessarily uphold patriotism.",
     des4: "These regimes also co-opted nationalistic discourse, donning patriotism as a mask in a masquerade of despotism. The repetitive use of nationalist slogans led—especially among younger generations—to an unconscious aversion, stripping the language of its genuine substance.",
     des5: "In this vacuum, hard-line Islam—detached from the collective historical memory—began permeating the social fabric of certain communities. Islamist movements exploited a deep-rooted sense of defeat, offering a religious identity to individuals confined within cultural and ethical-religious structures resistant to change. Through this identity, they found a semblance of security and a psychological substitute for unmet desires.",
     des6: "Modern communication technologies, of course, played a major role in facilitating the exchange of information, creating fertile ground for rebellion against tyranny. However, information is the foundation of knowledge—not knowledge itself. It contributes to the formation of mental representations, both consciously and subconsciously, through sensory inputs. Once external conditions permit, the subconscious pushes these representations to the surface.",
     des7: "If we examine the subconscious preparatory stages leading to the uprisings, we find a latent rejection of harsh realities and a constant search for release. The subconscious seeks ways to alleviate pressure, and when suitable conditions arise, this subconscious state transitions into conscious awareness. Given that many individuals in these societies share similar suffering, this awareness often evolves into a collective demand for radical change.",
     des8: "It must be emphasised that repression—be it political, social, or religious—is a core driver in prompting the mind to seek expression. Other factors, such as economic decline, also played a role by sealing off the final outlets for release, creating a societal pressure cooker. This was particularly true after Western countries closed off migration routes.",
     des9: "In such conditions, Islamist movements—better organised than their secular or liberal counterparts—quickly filled the political and cultural vacuum left behind. Although they gained momentum, their ability to sustain long-term governance remained questionable, as their structure mirrored that of the repressive regimes they opposed, particularly in their approach to censorship and control. More importantly, these movements remained trapped in a past era, disconnected from contemporary realities. Egypt is perhaps the clearest example of political Islam’s dwindling support base.",
     des10: "Among all Arab uprisings, the Syrian case emerged as the most complex, for a multitude of intertwined reasons. What began as calls for reform quickly met with violent repression, causing the demands to escalate into calls for regime change and the removal of President Bashar al-Assad.",
     des11: "At that time, Western powers—chiefly France, Britain, and the United States—appeared to adopt firm rhetoric, making statements such as 'Assad must step down' and declaring the regime illegitimate. Ambassadors were recalled, and diplomatic ties severed, leading many to believe that military intervention was imminent. Yet, nothing of the sort materialised.",
     des12: "Despite the heavy toll of the Syrian uprising, it failed to garner the trust of the country’s minorities. This stemmed from deep-seated mistrust among Syria’s social groups, disillusionment with the prospects of democratic transformation, and an absence of concrete guarantees for the protection of minority interests.",
     des13: "The Syrian opposition—whether the National Council or the later National Coalition—proved unable to offer meaningful reassurances. It failed to understand the legitimate fears of minorities, who were concerned about being marginalised in any post-regime future. Most opposition leaders lacked a true culture of diversity, viewing minorities through the lens of tolerance rather than equal partnership. While they repeated phrases such as 'respecting all communities,' their rhetoric lacked substance.",
     des14: "This shortcoming coincided with the rise of political Islam and the infiltration of jihadist groups, many of which targeted specific sects. This confirmed the regime’s narrative, which from the outset warned of extremist threats to minorities, using such claims to justify its brutal crackdown.",
     des15: "The regime capitalised on this chaos, presenting itself as the defender of minorities and benefiting from its long experience in exploiting the opposition’s errors. The spread of jihadist movements, in particular, gave the regime a pretext to consolidate its control.",
     des16: "Meanwhile, opposition groups focused on securing legitimacy from foreign sponsors, neglecting the crucial task of engaging Syria’s minorities—who constitute between 35% and 40% of the population. The mere inclusion of a few minority figures in opposition structures failed to create a genuine sense of representation.",
     des17: "Thus, the minority issue became a central part of the solution—but its neglect deepened the crisis and transformed the conflict into a protracted bloodbath.",
     des18: "Beyond the issue of minorities, many opposition figures remained incapable of formulating a realistic discourse aligned with national and international interests. Their language was emotional, reliant on slogans, lacking the experiential grounding required to grasp the ethical and political complexities of the Syrian conflict.",
     des19: "From a psychological and anthropological perspective, morality emerges from individual interactions with the environment. Moral systems evolve based on psychological needs and collective interests. As Schopenhauer suggested, morality often stems from individual egoism filtered through social adaptation.",
     des20: "Societies built on perpetual tension generate individuals unable to adapt to changing conditions. This explains why some opposition factions reduced the conflict to simplistic binaries—good versus evil, right versus wrong. They lacked strategic vision and remained confined by emotional responses, bound to shallow assumptions incompatible with Syria’s multifaceted reality.",
     des21: "Two crucial questions posed by Russia remain unanswered by the United States: – Who is the viable alternative to the current regime—capable of governing, safeguarding international interests, and maintaining control in Syria? – If Assad agrees to step down, where would he and his leadership go? And what happens to their assets? No country will finance their exile.",
     des22: "To date, no American team with adequate experience has emerged to manage the complexities of the Syrian file. U.S. policymakers appear to have internalised the opposition’s slogans, echoing them in a superficial attempt to promote certain figures and structures.",
     des23: "This lack of coherence is not unique to Washington. France and Britain have similarly faltered. Despite pushing for the lifting of the arms embargo on opposition groups, they hesitated to implement it, due to disagreements over potential consequences.",
     des24: "Many Western actors remain opposed to arming the opposition for several reasons: • The absence of a clear mechanism to distribute weapons safely, amid concerns that arms might fall into jihadist hands—with over 800 European jihadists reportedly active in Syria. • Fears that such actions would be seen as a strategic challenge to Russia, prompting it to escalate arms transfers to the regime and intensify the conflict. • The lack of a credible political alternative, reinforcing Russia’s insistence on a political settlement that maintains its influence in the region.",
     des25: "Russia views negotiation as an integral part of warfare. A comprehensive settlement requires the inclusion of all major stakeholders. American insistence on presenting the fragmented 'Coalition' as the sole representative at the Geneva II conference clashed with Moscow’s position.",
     des26: "A lasting solution cannot be reached without engaging moderate voices capable of articulating pragmatic demands and safeguarding the interests of all segments of society. Syria’s pluralism must be acknowledged and reflected in any viable settlement. The illusion of majority rule, if misapplied, risks dismantling the very unity it seeks to preserve.",
     des27: "While international consensus is essential, internal reconciliation is even more pressing. Ending the bloodshed demands the inclusion of all political forces and social groups in Syria. A serious dialogue must begin—one that addresses the root causes of the crisis, not just its symptoms.",
     des28: "Syria’s tragedy is not simply a power struggle; it is a crisis of identity, statehood, and social cohesion. Ignoring these elements has driven the country deeper into conflict. Experience has shown that exclusion, regardless of its source, only breeds extremism.",
     des29: "The United States and other influential powers must ease their insistence on the Coalition as the sole representative and open the door to a more inclusive framework"

      description: "An analysis of Syria’s ethnic and religious minorities in the context of the ongoing conflict and the role these groups play in Syria’s future political landscape.",
      des1: "In light of the fierce battle waged by the regime against its own people, it has become increasingly evident that the opposition’s leadership is struggling to respond effectively. There are several reasons for this: foremost among them is the absence of a diverse foundation of political parties within the Syrian body politic—save for the Kurdish parties, who, despite enduring harsh repression, have long been engaged in activism and moments of heightened mobilisation. Another key reason is the lack of pluralistic thought embedded within Syrian culture and society.",
      des2: "The Syrian regime has played a pivotal role in nurturing and activating a singular trend within the consciousness of individuals, by constructing a monolithic cultural model. This model has been built upon a framework of curated information and accumulated memories, which are then used to reinforce a specific culture—resulting in a unified vision and strategy. Such a model limits individuals’ capacities for understanding what might be considered creative or constructive processes. It fosters mental rigidity and an unwillingness to entertain alternative interpretations of reality.",
      des3: "Evidence of this can be found in the striking similarity between the discourse employed by the Syrian regime and that of the opposition. Despite their ideological differences and fierce rivalry, the dominant modes of rhetoric, analysis, and strategy appear remarkably alike. The regime relies heavily on stirring up fear among minorities—be they ethnic, religious, sectarian, or ideological—of the political Islam present among some of the regime’s opponents.",
      des4: "This fear becomes a vital card in the regime’s hand, enabling it to recast the conflict as a binary one: either with or against Assad. For instance, the regime often exploits Arab nationalist sentiments which, by their nature, position all ethnic minorities as subordinate. We witnessed a similar bias during the recent Cairo conference of the Syrian opposition, where some displayed a rigid stance regarding the recognition of the Kurdish people’s rights, despite the fact that Kurds are indigenous and deeply rooted in this region.",
      des5: "Many Syrians continue to view the Kurdish issue through the lens of conspiracy. In anticipation of potential recognition of their rights, they accuse the Kurds of plotting secession and seeking to establish an independent Kurdish entity in the region. It is imperative to recall the long history of Kurdish resistance against the Syrian regime’s oppression. Since the days of Hafez al-Assad, Kurds have played a significant role in Syria’s broader struggle. Their persecution began as early as the 1950s, culminating in the racially motivated 1962 census—signed by President Nazim al-Qudsi—which stripped over 120,000 Kurdish citizens of their nationality, launching a systematic campaign of marginalisation.",
      des6: "History bears witness to the deep-rooted connection of the Kurdish people to the Syrian homeland. This will become more apparent during a transitional phase of independence, in which citizenship is upheld as a fundamental right. Yet, the rise of Arab nationalist sentiment marked the beginning of discrimination across Syrian society, particularly the denial of even the most basic rights to ethnic minorities. Addressing the Kurdish issue—acknowledging past wrongs and seeking to redress them—serves to advance the revolutionary cause and to lay the foundation for a nation built on equal citizenship.",
      des7: "For this reason, it is also essential to speak about other minorities, notably the Alawite sect, which constitutes an integral part of any solution. Winning the trust of the Alawi community could hasten the collapse of the Assad regime by opening channels of dialogue with individuals who might serve as influential intermediaries. The opposition must embrace inclusive national rhetoric, ensuring that Alawis are part of Syria’s future political landscape.",
      des8: "Alawis and other religious minorities are gripped by a deep fear of persecution. We must not overlook the Alawis’ history of suffering, preserved in our collective memory—replete with experiences of marginalisation and discrimination dating back to the time of Sultan Abdulhamid. Recollecting this history is crucial if we are to break free from the legacy of historical isolation and extreme poverty that gave rise to stark class divides.",
      des9: "What is sorely lacking in this climate of high tension is the inclusion of the silent segments of society, as well as those aligned with the regime, who, much like their counterparts in the opposition, are acting from a position of self-preservation. Bringing these groups into the fold could enrich the uprising and help it reflect Syria’s national diversity more faithfully.",
      des10: "In this regard, I believe that upholding the principle of credibility—especially in terms of news and information—will benefit us greatly. It could help reassure those frightened groups whose only current motivation is a yearning for stability, security, and calm.",
      des11: "We must also recognise that there are obscure elements within the revolutionary movement that are, whether knowingly or not, serving the interests of Assad and prolonging his grip on power. The violent acts carried out by certain factions within the opposition are often in pursuit of narrow self-interest. While these actions have rightly drawn criticism, they should not be allowed to undermine the broader importance of the revolutionary movement. Instead, we must work to expose such actors and isolate them, ensuring that the struggle does not descend into sectarian conflict—a scenario that would only serve the agendas of regional powers."

      description: "Since its eruption, the Syrian uprising—confronting a totalitarian regime—has struggled to win over ethnic and religious minorities, as well as other groups wary of losing the individual freedoms they had under Assad should Islamists rise to power. Various factors have fuelled the fears and hesitation of these communities. Chief among them is a growing sense of hopelessness that any genuine social or cultural transformation will take place, particularly given the territorial and societal inroads made by religious rebels, who have managed to penetrate the very fabric of Syrian society. The censorship imposed on individuals has allowed radical religious currents to infiltrate daily life, becoming a last refuge for many. The psychological toll inflicted by the regime’s repressive mechanisms has stripped individuals of the capacity to envision self-sufficient ways of improving their conditions. Faced with these frustrations—present at every level of society—it is understandable that many seek refuge in religion as a means of coping with their daily realities, a way to compensate for their losses, even if this compensation is illusory or unrealistic. This pattern is often seen in societies subjected to totalitarian oppression.",
      des1: "Islamists in Syria are increasingly descending upon the popular movement, positioning themselves as the strongest and most widespread current among the Syrian factions, relying heavily on the religious and conservative foundations of certain communities.",
      des2: "Their prominence stems, firstly, from the belief among many Syrians involved in the uprising that the international community has abandoned them, leaving them vulnerable to the regime’s brutality. Secondly, it arises from the Islamists’ strategic exploitation of the Syrian psyche, allowing them to infiltrate the public sphere in a systematic and organised manner.",
      des3: "Moreover, their control over the distribution of aid and humanitarian supplies has substantially bolstered their visibility in public squares and streets, giving the impression that they have monopolised the uprising.",
      des4: "They have seized upon the division between communities previously favoured by the regime and those they refer to as the majority, reinforcing sectarian discrimination and fuelling hostility and estrangement between these groups, all in a bid to widen their base.",
      des5: "They also invoke the notion of a 'strongest majority,' asserting that such a majority has the right to dictate society’s direction and values. It is essential here to question how they define both majority and minority, which, in their eyes, are homogenous and singular blocs.",
      des6: "Syrian society comprises non-Arab ethnic groups—possibly making up more than 15% of the population—as well as various religious and sectarian communities totalling around 20% or more. Even among the largest group, Sunni Arabs, there exists considerable diversity.",
      des7: "It is inaccurate to treat Sufis, Salafists, and members of the Muslim Brotherhood as a monolithic bloc. Nor are all Islamists part of a single trend—Jihadi Salafists differ fundamentally from their non-Jihadi counterparts.",
      des8: "Diverse interpretations of the Qur’an and the presence of multiple theological schools further illustrate the internal plurality of this group.",
      des9: "The Syrian equation extends far beyond the country’s borders, influenced by regional actors providing generous financial support to Islamist movements. This makes Islamists serious players on the Syrian stage, with considerable sway over the course of the uprising, often skewing it towards specific religious orientations.",
      des10: "This is being done at the expense of other Syrian groups—who would constitute a majority if seen as a single bloc—willing to undertake comprehensive cultural, social, and intellectual reform.",
      des11: "It is important not to overlook the fact that secular Muslims represent a significant proportion of Syrian society. This necessitates a reassessment of the demographic and ideological blocs within Syria in order to reshape the political equation in favour of the secularists and their allies, thereby exposing the Islamists for what they are: a small minority with neither substantial political nor cultural weight inside the country.",
      des12: "Undoubtedly, Islamic parties that claim to be undergoing reform and re-evaluating their principles should be given a fair opportunity. Yet, to date, these parties have failed to translate their stated intentions into practical actions within Syria. Instead, they appear to be working relentlessly to marginalise any group or individual posing a credible alternative.",
      des13: "The principle of competition between forces with equal standing remains the greatest driver of enduring reform. It is this dynamic that allows for the refinement of social, economic, and political programmes aimed at improving the individual’s standard of living and expanding opportunities for personal creativity.",
      des14: "This can only be achieved by adopting a framework of genuine partnership among all societal groups—beginning with a call for national reconciliation and the inclusion of all social components.",
      des15: "I believe that the primary responsibility for the ongoing violence rests with the regime, which has immersed itself in a so-called security solution. Secondly, blame lies with the Islamists, who are relentlessly working to Islamise the uprising, seeking to exclude diverse voices.",
      des16: "Thirdly, the responsibility falls on the segments of Syrian society that continue to abstain from participation in the uprising, while simultaneously refusing to present themselves as legitimate partners.",
      des17: "We all bear responsibility for what is unfolding in Syria—from Assad’s crimes to the human rights abuses committed by elements within the opposition against regime supporters. We must now begin to denounce all violations committed by both sides and hold accountable anyone—individual or group—who incites public hostility against a particular community.

In this context, it becomes increasingly plausible that political Islam will seek to exploit the unconscious energies fuelling these revolts, especially in societies that lack clear political vision or well-defined institutional frameworks.",
      des1: "It is for this reason that the need to expose these movements becomes ever more urgent. They pose a grave threat—not only to our societies specifically, but also to human thought in general. These movements are fundamentally anti-civilisational, undermining scientific achievement and intellectual freedom, despite their hollow claims of safeguarding knowledge, diversity, and individual liberty.",
      des2: "The attempt to unmask the true face of these radical Islamist movements should not be misconstrued as an attack on Islam itself. On the contrary, it stems from a desire to liberate Islam from its tribal origins, so that it might adapt to the evolving dynamics of history and modernity.",
      des3: "Perhaps we must also turn our attention to the Arab-Islamic psyche, which harbours within it a certain form of awareness—sometimes even a recognition—that the world has moved beyond it. Although this psyche is dispersed across diverse societies, and although the collective memory of each varies due to different social structures, these societies share common afflictions and comparable symptoms.",
      des4: "This is largely due to the influence of two unifying factors: religion and language—beneath which the Arab world is broadly unified.",
      des5: "Before delving further, it is worth reflecting on the role of language in shaping collective consciousness and harmonising individual perception. Language wields a powerful influence in bringing people together; it carries with it layers of accumulated experience passed down through generations.",
      des6: "The models we internalise are often drawn from visual memory or oral transmission, frequently charged with emotional resonance. Since the invention of writing, human beings have recorded their thoughts—and in doing so, their behaviours—embedding them in the collective memory.",
      des7: "These records manifest as customs, which arise from a process of communal filtration of individual experiences. What aligns with the external environment is retained; what does not is discarded. Over time, these filtered experiences become the foundations of communal ethics and codes of conduct, imposed upon individuals.",
      des8: "What Islam has attempted to do—or more precisely, what it has done over centuries (as with other religions)—is to implant mental representations that offer psychological comfort in the face of a painful, deprived reality.",
      des9: "What sets Islam apart in our current era, however, is its insistence on excluding the other—a trait that contemporary iterations of other religions have largely abandoned. These religions were previously excluded from political structures, and were thus compelled to adopt a more spiritual character, one that better aligns with individual psychological needs.",
      des10: "The goal, then, is to return religions—and the gods they invoke—to their original source: the human psyche.",
      des11: "This calls for a critical reassessment of the history curriculum in Arab schools with Islamic cultural orientations. While differences in emphasis exist between countries, these curricula are often deliberately structured to generate imagery of Islamic victories and to instil a sense of superiority over others.",
      des12: "This attitude is encapsulated in a phrase repeated by many Muslims: “Thank God for the blessing of Islam”—a statement laden with chauvinism and implicit exclusion of the other.",
      des13: "Undoubtedly, the Muslim individual’s experience of marginalisation and their repeated frustrations—stemming from an inability to contribute creatively or civilisationally, as others do—has led to a kind of internalised, limited awareness, one that is constantly nourished by sacred history and unquestioned texts.",
      des14: "Let me reiterate: the problem does not lie with Islam per se, but with the structure of all religions, which tend to deprive the individual of even their most basic physical needs. Religions enclose individuals within a shell through which clerics extend their control over communities.",
      des15: "It must also be noted that most religions and belief systems engage in a process of erasing what preceded them—even as they borrow and absorb the ideas of those prior systems. They claim for themselves the mantle of salvation, enlightenment, or truth.",
      des16: "This is made especially clear in Islam’s depiction of pre-Islamic Arabia as an age of ignorance (jahiliyyah), thereby dismissing all prior knowledge and heritage—even though Islam itself is a product of that very cultural and historical milieu.",
      des17: "Our pride in religious or cultural identity is often the result of a process of self-glorification. Individuals tend to affirm that which mirrors their own psychological and cultural structure, while rejecting what is unfamiliar or different. This is what we mean by perception. Expanding one’s awareness requires openness to difference.",
      des18: "The rigidity with which individuals cling to their beliefs, cultures, or inherited knowledge is largely the product of conditioned indoctrination.",
      des19: "Returning to the subject of mental representations drawn from distorted histories—delivered to children through school curricula, reinforced in places of worship, or transmitted through the general culture of Islamised societies—recent neurological studies show that these representations become fixed in the long-term collective memory through repeated exposure.",

We find that Islamic culture, in particular, has sought to strip Islamised societies of their pre-existing histories, positioning itself as the sole origin of knowledge and science, thus denying the wider human contribution that preceded it.",

      des1: "There is no doubt that the cultural framework — encompassing beliefs, customs, and behaviours — is a product of the level of consciousness within a given society.",
      des2: "Equally, it is undeniable that we all strive to elevate our consciousness to grasp what currently lies beyond our understanding.",
      des3: "It may also be necessary to revisit the past in order to comprehend what was once obscure to humankind — to understand how humans became prey to psychological fears, which they sought to suppress through myth, spiritual practices, and eventually, religion.",
      des4: "With this in mind, I have chosen to clarify in this article the mechanism by which the brain has evolved over time, drawing on certain contemporary neurological theories.",
      des5: "Michael Persinger contends that changes in two fundamental brain structures — the hippocampus and the amygdala — contributed to our acquisition of two key traits: the capacity for memory and for evaluating events.",
      des6: "He argues that memory is grounded in emotional charges and sensations, driven by the principles of reward and punishment.",
      des7: "Persinger concluded that over time, stimuli affecting the hippocampus enabled the reactivation of past memories. These memories, in turn, were embellished by human imagination and fantasy.",
      des8: "The amygdala, meanwhile, evolved into a central hub for regulating emotions associated with experiences, allowing us to feel joy, delight, or intense depression.",
      des9: "From this, it becomes clear that memory — particularly long-term memory — forms the foundation for the development of human consciousness, enabling us to store accumulated experiences across time.",
      des10: "Gerald Edelman added another vital concept to our understanding of brain development: the notion of value, which is linked to personal history and the experiences it produces.",
      des11: "The brain’s evolutionary capacity to form mental representations and internal scenes, he argued, emerged from this store of experiences — preserved in long-term memory as both cognitive and emotional values.",
      des12: "Henri Laborit, for his part, explored the influence of social culture on memory, suggesting that it generates a kind of automaticity in the individual, which he called “cultural categorisation”.",
      des13: "According to Laborit, culture and the surrounding environment shape the course of memory by filtering information in accordance with the group’s cultural norms and its shifting needs.",
      des14: "In order to define individual need within a collective framework, he proposed that such need represents a quantity of energy or information required to sustain neural structures — whether innate or acquired through learning.",
      des15: "He described this mechanism as a stable transformation in neural connections: cells produce peptide chains that generate proteins, which in turn form new neural links in response to external stimuli.",
      des16: "In this context, “need” becomes a primary driver. Within a collective setting, however, these needs can only be fulfilled through the principle of “group dominance”, which transforms the balance between internal and external needs into a tool of control over others.",
      des17: "It is through this process, according to Laborit, that hierarchical structures between groups emerged.",
      des18: "The more deeply we delve into what occurs within the human brain from a scientific standpoint, the wider the gap becomes between us and the superstitious thinking that still prevails in many cultures.",
      des19: "This superstitious mindset forms a kind of inherited cognitive barrier that hinders the mind’s openness. We cannot transcend this barrier without a rigorous scientific pursuit of the unknown.",
      des20: "Only through science and knowledge can we expand our awareness. If we were to journey through the brain guided by neuropsychology, we would discover countless mental representations — both conscious and unconscious.",
      des21: "Yet only conscious representations have the power to break the automaticity of thought and to generate new laws and insights through awareness.",
      des22: "Focusing on Edelman’s theory, we see that he offered an explanation for the evolution of the human brain. In his book The Biology of Consciousness, he described a reciprocal relationship between genetic influences on behaviour and the impact of behaviour on genes.",
      des23: "He asserted that the environment plays a role in selecting certain behaviours through natural selection. Yet, he also argued that individual behaviour, in turn, shapes the process of natural selection within the environment.",
      des24: "Moreover, Edelman highlighted the importance of morphology — the study of form — in the development of consciousness, suggesting that this process arose from the gradual selection and evolution of the nervous system, a phenomenon referred to as morphological evolution.",
      des25: "Let us pause briefly to consider the relationship between genes and natural selection, in order to understand how behaviours that are not genetically inherited can still be acquired.",
      des26: "Before we do so, it is worth offering a short historical overview. Gregor Mendel was the first to lay the theoretical foundations for genetics, paving the way for further exploration into heredity and evolution.",
      des27: "This progress ultimately led to the integration of Darwinian theory with genetics into a unified scientific framework, allowing researchers to explain the connection between genetic function and natural selection.",
      des28: "To shed further light on the development of neural structures in the brain, it will also be useful to examine the history of how consciousness itself emerged and evolved.",

     description: "In the first part, I paused at the mechanism behind the evolution of consciousness. In this article, I turn to a more contemporary theory: the Theory of Neuronal Group Selection, proposed by Gerald Edelman, a biologist and director of the Neurosciences Institute in La Jolla, California.",
       des1: "Edelman divided consciousness into two levels: primary consciousness and higher-order consciousness—the latter being distinguished by its greater complexity and cognitive depth.",
       des2: "What is primary consciousness?",
       des3: "Edelman posited that primary consciousness arises from two systems within the nervous system.",
       des4: "The first consists of structures such as the brainstem and the limbic system. This network governs essential biological functions including feeding, sexual behaviour, and defensive strategies—functions shaped and inherited through evolution. It also oversees other basic processes like respiration, sweating, and sleep. In essence, it forms the foundation for survival and is present in all organisms equipped with a nervous system.",
       des5: "The second system is the thalamo-cortical complex, which includes the thalamus—the central hub of the brain composed of various nuclei responsible for relaying sensory signals to the cortex. This complex acts as a gatekeeper, filtering incoming information: amplifying some signals while attenuating others.",
       des6: "Over evolutionary time, these two systems became interconnected, giving rise to what Edelman calls primary consciousness—a capacity enabling living beings to adapt to their environments. Learning thus becomes the essential mechanism of adaptation in both humans and animals, as the environment is not fixed but constantly shifting across time and space. Nature, through selection, eliminates maladaptive structures and preserves those that adjust effectively. Behaviour, rooted in environmental experience, is shaped by this process of learning, driven fundamentally by the need to meet physiological demands and the impulses governed by the brainstem and limbic system.",
       des7: "According to Edelman, primary consciousness developed in parallel with evolution, and was enabled by three key mechanisms:",
       des8: "1. The cortical system, which allowed for the integration of cognitive concepts with emotional processes, thereby expanding the brain’s capacity to learn.",
       des9: "2. A novel form of conceptual memory, capable of organising and categorising inputs from various brain systems, thus enabling the classification of perceptual processes.",
       des10: "3. Reentrant loops—complex neural circuits that permit continuous, recursive exchange of information (feedback) across connected structures. These loops enable memory to process perceptual classification in real-time, facilitating adaptive responses.",
       des11: "Edelman, alongside Giulio Tononi, emphasised the importance of the thalamo-cortical loops in the emergence of consciousness. They argue that primary consciousness in both humans and animals stems from the interaction between short-term memory and perceptual classification—a dynamic interplay that gives rise to conscious experience.",
       des12: "While organisms with primary consciousness can form internal images, Edelman contended that they lack the ability to observe those images through the lens of a social self—a distinctly human capacity that emerged with the evolution of higher cognitive functions. Higher-order consciousness enables the brain to link each mental representation to others, forming interconnected chains of thought.",
       des13: "We thus distinguish between perceptual classification, which interprets sensory input from the external world, and conceptual classification, which occurs internally, relying on memory to shape abstract concepts.",
       des14: "Although this capacity is most developed in humans, studies suggest that chimpanzees also possess elements of self-awareness. The development of individuality is closely tied to social interaction, through which one constructs a model of the world by connecting past, present, and future—a process requiring symbolic memory. The evolution of vocal tracts and brain regions involved in language comprehension and production was instrumental in the development of spoken language, which in turn played a central role in the expansion of human consciousness and the emergence of the self.",
       des15: "These social interactions, and the resulting ability to store symbolic relationships over extended periods—through the convergence of multiple memory systems and the emergence of experience-based memory—enabled humans to link the past with the present and imagine the future. This played a pivotal role in the development of higher-order consciousness.",
       des16: "According to Edelman, the brain is subject to two selective processes: natural selection, and somatic selection, the latter being a refinement within the former. These mechanisms enable the brain to connect sensory signals with mental representations, leading to the formation of consciousness based on the interplay between perception, conceptual frameworks, and memory—all shaped by a value system that evolved over time.",
       des17: "In The Biology of Consciousness, Edelman explains how higher-order consciousness contributes to the emergence of imagination, emotion, sensation, thought, selfhood, and volition. Human behaviour, he argues, is driven by memory, which is itself shaped by reclassification processes that respond to biological shifts and evolving value systems.",
       des18: "When considering these modern theories, it becomes evident that our engagement with concepts—whether social or religious—is rooted in an ongoing process of transformation across time. There is no fixed perception, no immutable concept. Rather, the values we ascribe to the external world stem from a consciousness that is itself in flux, adjusting in response to life and nature.",
       des19: "Over millions of years, evolution has selected for learning mechanisms that enable living organisms to adapt to varying environments. Thus, morality—emerging from our perceptual evaluation of phenomena—is not static, but evolves as our perception shifts, either generating new values or abandoning those no longer suited to the changing external context.",

     description: "An analytical essay originally published in Al-Hiwar al-Mutamaddin on 14 April 2011, exploring the psychological and structural mechanisms of totalitarian regimes with a focus on Syria.",
     des1: "There is no doubt that cultural structures and historical heritage vary considerably across Arab countries. Yet, despite these differences, totalitarian regimes throughout the region repeat and reproduce the same mechanisms of repression to which they subject their populations. This is because the very architecture of these regimes—and the power apparatuses that sustain them—are shaped by analogous developmental processes and rest upon a similar psychological foundation. Totalitarian regimes are inherently incapable of comprehending anything that transcends their repressive tools and methods.",
     des2: "Likewise, although revolutions differ significantly in structure, intensity, causes, and consequences, it is possible to discern shared denominators and commonalities in the general conditions that give rise to them, as well as in their primary objectives.",
     des3: "Revolutions that have occurred in various parts of the world and in differing historical contexts have generally been the product of a conscious ferment, simmering beneath the surface as a result of a collective experience of hardship and suffering. If we examine the underlying mechanism of revolutions carefully, we find that such events are preceded by various stages of unconscious accumulation.",
     des4: "Individual subjects typically begin by observing their social grievances in silence, yet with a conscious awareness. They attempt to resolve these issues through civil society institutions, wherever such institutions exist and wherever a minimal degree of freedom is granted. However, when such channels are absent, or when intellectual diversity is stifled, the capacity to transform awareness into reform becomes severely constrained. In such contexts, individuals confront a political system governed by a totalitarian logic, dominated by a singular orientation that excludes all diversity of thought and sentiment.",
     des5: "Totalitarian regimes draw their strength (and, indeed, their fragility) from the systematic suppression of any individual effort to think independently or seek solutions to social problems without the intervention of the state. These regimes often respond to such initiatives with severe physical and psychological punishment.",
     des6: "In these systems, acts of independent agency aimed at improving society can be so thoroughly marginalised that they are often mistaken for mere expressions of general frustration or anger—outbursts triggered by the continuous repression of libidinal forces and human drives. Individuals trapped within the iron grip of a despotic regime suffer acute psychological afflictions. Their frustration may manifest in distorted behaviours and internal contradictions. On the one hand, they attempt to convince themselves that no escape is possible, that survival requires surrender. This surrender becomes a kind of deliberate apathy. They may even begin to adopt the slogans propagated by their repressive regimes, using them as a form of compensation for the absence of fulfilment or self-actualisation.",
     des7: "Through this apparatus of repression and deliberate marginalisation, despotic regimes seek to obliterate both individual identity and intellect. They pervert the human subject, turning them against their own desires and aspirations. In this context, one must acknowledge the role of religious institutions, which are tactically mobilised to cultivate religious extremism. Despotic regimes understand all too well that their survival depends on the intellectual and psychological suppression of their people.",
     des8: "If we examine the Syrian regime as an example of this phenomenon, we find a longstanding and deliberate effort to encourage fundamentalist religions within Syria. Its relative success in maintaining control over Syrian society hinges on this duplicitous strategy. On the surface, it presents itself as a secular government, restricting the freedoms of certain Islamic fundamentalist groups that openly challenge its authority. Yet, simultaneously, it plays an active role in spreading a culture of religious fundamentalism at a broader popular level. In doing so, the regime manufactures a justification for excluding and suppressing religious groups deemed to have an anti-government agenda.",
     des9: "This duplicity is also evident in the Syrian regime’s foreign policy. It has actively disseminated narratives and ideas that bear little resemblance to reality or to the concealed intentions behind its policies. The regime has succeeded in persuading both its own citizens and other nations in the region that it supports the oppressed and colonised peoples of the Middle East and that it represents the beating heart of Arab nationalism. Its propaganda rests on empty slogans, bolstered by a few media stories and official statements. In truth, however, this regime does not hesitate to offer concessions or compromises—whether to real or imagined adversaries—if doing so ensures its continued grip on power.",
     des10: "The regime has also tirelessly propagated the notion of conspiracy, exaggerating external threats from neighbouring countries to compensate its people for their repressed desires. A Syrian citizen is led to believe that they hold immense significance in the region, that their usurped ego is in fact collective, not individual. This collective ego is presented as perfectly aligned with the identity of the regime. The notion of conspiracy and foreign threat serves as a psychological sedative, accounting for the widespread submission and complacency among many Syrians.",
     des11: "Of course, the Syrian people are not the only population subjected to such manipulation. The same political tactic is deployed by other totalitarian regimes, and particularly by religious groups whose ideologies stand opposed to progress, transformation, and the very principle of life. The conspiracy theory becomes the only palliative available to a people who have nothing new to contribute to humanity and who are no longer capable of understanding anything beyond their narrow systems of belief and knowledge. Certainly, competing interests exist between nations and global powers seeking dominance—but totalitarian regimes habitually use such tensions as a pretext to suppress their own citizens in the name of foreign policy.",
     des12: "To understand the psychological mechanism by which oppressed individuals come to adopt the very slogans and vocabulary of their oppressors, one can turn to Robert Zajonc’s theory of the mere exposure effect. According to Zajonc, repeated exposure to a particular idea renders it more palatable. The brain, compelled by frequency, begins to favour this stimulus. In other words, the mere repetition of an idea enhances its acceptability and may even cause it to be internalised as truth—particularly when it corresponds with emotional impulses or psychological motivations such as fear of punishment or hope of reward. At that point, the individual mind loses its capacity to perceive reality with clarity and detachment.",
     des13: "The more deeply a totalitarian regime sinks into despotism, the more it imitates the structures and strategies of religious belief systems. This enables it to enslave every element of the society it rules. The Syrian regime serves as a prime example. The attempt to elevate the head of state into a quasi-sacred figure, to be venerated by citizens who live through and for the ‘leader’, is grounded in psychological manipulation. The goal is to dissolve the individual ego within the symbolic figure of the ruler, creating a shared emotional structure that is endlessly reinforced by media propaganda. Ironically, this mechanism may produce a perverse sense of identity—one that is occasionally rewarded with trifling privileges which pale in comparison to the regime’s own hoarded power and wealth.",
     des14: "Let us return to those preliminary, unconscious phases that precede revolutionary outbreaks. Having outlined some of the mechanisms of psychological repression faced by individuals, we can observe how such apparatuses reach a point of perversion in which repressed individuals voluntarily and consciously adopt the language and logic of their oppressors—thus becoming agents of repression themselves.",
     des15: "And yet, the unconscious mind does not accept this alienation. It rebels against the psychological crisis and seeks an outlet. This is the stage of unconscious fermentation: a violent internal struggle between the ego and the unconscious. When shared by many within a single cultural context, this struggle becomes a collective drive—a form of group therapy, a shared attempt to find a way out of an unbearable condition. In psychoanalytic terms, the unconscious perpetually seeks to mitigate suffering and process the negative drives repressed by social structures. Under such strain, even a minor external trigger can provoke an eruption. Suppressed impulses spill forth, first gradually and then in the form of conscious collective action aimed at radical transformation.",
     des16: "Revolutions are, at their inception, an unconscious effort. The psychological desires and shared drives of individuals accumulate over time, eventually converging into a conscious force for change—often without the backing of any prior political or social structures equipped to absorb the shock of transformation.",
     des17: "At this critical juncture, the role of intellectuals and experts becomes vital. They must help to structure and guide this raw, apolitical, and socially unanchored desire for change. A theoretical framework must be developed to support revolutionary movements, helping them navigate the disorder of revolutionary periods and their aftermath. This intervention is not meant to contain or subdue the revolutionary impulse, but rather to offer a forward-looking vision and to lay the foundations of diversity for future political and social engagement.",
     des18: "It is also clear that revolutions can unleash counter-revolutionary energies that work against their founding principles. We have witnessed such dangers in the aftermath of the Tunisian and Egyptian revolutions. The sudden rise and mobilisation of religious fundamentalism in both countries illustrates how revolutionary movements remain vulnerable to being hijacked, and how their democratic aspirations can be thwarted. Political Islam is capable of distorting the original motives that inspired revolutionary action, transforming them into new instruments of repression—not unlike those wielded by the very regimes they sought to overthrow."

      description: "At a time when popular uprisings across the Arab world intensify in their call for freedom, social justice, and an end to the tyranny and exploitation practised by authoritarian regimes, we are confronted with a striking contradiction in how different movements and ideologies understand the very notion of freedom.",
      des1: "Among these, political Islam presents itself as the most fitting project for societies where the majority profess the Islamic faith. Yet in doing so, it excludes all who do not share its beliefs or vision—advancing a narrow political framework that, in essence, mirrors the same authoritarianism it claims to oppose.",
      des2: "To realise its project, political Islam begins with the Islamisation of everyday life—seeking to permeate all aspects of social and personal existence. It aims to subjugate the individual through the imposition of rules and norms set by those who call themselves scholars of Islam. In this vision, the individual is not recognised as an autonomous being but merely as a component of the collective.",
      des3: "As for justice and equality, they are not extended to non-Muslims—whether they are of Muslim origin but have chosen a different worldview, or whether they belong to other faiths altogether. Political Islam divides the world into two spheres: that of Muslims, and that of non-Muslims, the latter of whom must be subdued and brought under the authority of the former.",
      des4: "Other ideologies, such as Arab nationalism—though now lacking a strong popular base—are equally unable to provide a theoretical framework that guarantees justice and equality among the region’s diverse ethnic groups. Their slogans often erase or marginalise distinct identities such as the Kurds, Amazigh, and others who have the full right to preserve their languages, cultural heritage, and unique ways of life.",
      des5: "Before we can meaningfully address the concepts of liberty and justice, we must first consider the foundations that unite individuals within a single society—a shared cultural framework that encompasses all segments of the population without discrimination. This collective culture is shaped by what might be termed a 'mental universe'—a shared cognitive structure composed of symbols, principles, and mutual interests that bind people together and foster a sense of belonging.",
      des6: "But what exactly constitutes this 'mental universe'? It consists of images, ideas, and words that circulate unconsciously in daily life. These are mental representations stored in our collective memory, absorbed from birth through external conditioning. We do not choose when these stored images appear, nor do we always control our response to them.",
      des7: "Yet this is not to suggest we are powerless before these inherited mental constructs. Storing something in long-term memory and recalling it later requires, at some level, implicit consent to its content. We are capable of revisiting these representations, examining them consciously, and deciding whether to accept or reject them. However, this process is only possible within an environment that protects the individual’s right to think, speak, and criticise freely—what we might call a 'free space'.",
      des8: "Social life is, by nature, a mixture of conflicting psychological tendencies: a desire for competition, which drives progress, and a tendency towards cooperation, which fosters social cohesion and stability. Mutual interest is thus key to survival, but interest alone is not enough. It must be paired with intelligence—the kind that produces ethical frameworks capable of ensuring justice for all, without discrimination.",
      des9: "Awareness—of both our external surroundings and our internal psychological structures—is what enables us to recognise others and forge new foundations for coexistence. This depends on our ability to create shared interests among individuals and between communities. But such innovation can only occur through a deeper knowledge—one that dismantles the religious and ideological barriers that reinforce divisions.",
      des10: "Nationalist ideologies assert their supremacy over other ethnicities; patriotism emphasises national uniqueness; familial loyalties reinforce social stratification; and religious doctrines proclaim their own chosen status: the Muslim thanks God for the 'blessing' of Islam; the Christian sees himself as a beloved child of the divine; the Jew as one chosen by God. All of these frameworks operate on the logic of distinction—claiming for themselves a moral right to dominate or marginalise others.",
      des11: "Such notions are wholly incompatible with the idea of free individual space and the principle of equality before the law. Thus, we may conclude that the path to freedom begins with knowledge and awareness—concepts that stand in direct opposition to the tenets of political Islam and dominant regional ideologies.",
      des12: "True freedom begins with an independent capacity for thought: thought unbound by inherited mental representations imposed for specific ends. As Henri Laborit once suggested, perhaps we should replace the ideals of 'freedom' and 'equality' with 'awareness' and 'knowledge'. These are the true foundations of tolerance and dialogue—both within societies and across them.",
      des13: "And perhaps, one day, we will reach a broader humanist understanding that transcends geography and nationhood. Perhaps, one day, we will go even further—towards an expanded vision of humanity that recognises the right of all living beings to exist and thrive."

      description: "This article delves into the emergence of Wahhabi fundamentalism in Arab societies and its consequences, the rise of Islamist movements, and the role of the new generation in shaping the future.",
      des1: "There is no doubt that numerous factors enabled the Wahhabi brand of fundamentalism, emanating from Saudi Arabia, to tighten its grip and extend its influence over the deepest fabrics of Arab societies—societies still plagued by poverty, soaring unemployment, corrupt governance, and the widespread persecution, brainwashing, and marginalisation of individuals.",
      des2: "These fundamentalist movements not only benefitted from the suffocating conditions endured by their targeted social structures; more significantly, they found themselves thriving within a vast cultural vacuum. Arab regimes, in their ruthless pursuit of systematic repression against intellectuals and activists, inadvertently carved out a gaping chasm between the public and those intellectuals who retreated behind the gates of an elitist ghetto. That withdrawal only deepened their disconnect from the general populace.",
      des3: "One of the consequences of this intellectual ghettoisation was the emergence of a discursive and linguistic impasse, marked by the use of abstruse terminology and complex rhetoric. This, in turn, became an added barrier fuelling the rupture between intellectuals and the public. The language they employed lacked the mental imagery necessary to reach and resonate with the everyday individual. Psychological studies have illuminated this phenomenon—often referred to as the “independence complex”—which suggests that ideas evolve into independent cognitive units before they can be absorbed. From a neuropsychological standpoint, ideas influence individuals only when mediated through emotions. Abstract concepts must first be transformed into sensory images, which then coalesce into a psychological experience capable of leaving a lasting imprint on the mind.",
      des4: "Taking the Tunisian revolutionary experience as an example—a movement sparked by the spontaneous uprising of young men and women—it is vital to recall that this revolt did not emerge from a void, nor was it solely the consequence of Bouazizi’s self-immolation. Rather, it unfolded in a climate of intense tension, to which Bouazizi’s tragic act added fuel.",
      des5: "This uprising could not have endured without the support of several enabling factors along the way. Chief among them was the role played by the new media. A prominent group on social networks known as Takriz had, for many years, garnered a considerable following by grounding their posts and blogs in the tangible realities of Tunisian youth.",
      des6: "Founded in 1998 on the Internet by a group of Tunisian youths using various pseudonyms, Takriz began with two core members and gradually expanded into a movement with tangible influence over the daily lives of countless young Tunisians. One major element that bolstered the connection between Takriz and successive generations of youth was the group’s use of street-inspired slang—language devoid of decorum or pretension. At times, their expressions bordered on the vulgar, perhaps deliberately so, as a way to capture attention and resonate more directly with their audience. Their goal was to bring down the oppressive Tunisian regime, and the group’s administrators remained faithful to that mission, avoiding the lure of public accolades. They played a pivotal role in galvanising and coordinating the January uprising.",
      des7: "This brings us back to our initial point—the rupture between Arab intellectuals and the general public, a breach that paved the way for Islamist movements to flourish and embed themselves within the susceptible minds of disillusioned youth. These movements not only grew in influence but deepened the sense of abandonment felt by a generation who increasingly resembled a forsaken child.",
      des8: "Under such circumstances, Islamists found it easier to establish ties with broad segments of society, largely because they had social programmes, financial resources, and a mastery of emotionally charged language. This is the language of emotion—of indistinct, uncritical thought. In stark contrast, most intellectuals clung to a convoluted, inaccessible discourse laden with affected expression, readily excluding any ideas that failed to align with their worldview.",
      des9: "Among the other reasons that facilitated the proliferation of Islamist fundamentalism, perhaps the most critical was a deeply entrenched scepticism towards the project of Arab nationalism. Islamists were, to a great extent, the only ones who succeeded in capitalising on the collective sense of defeat among Arab nations and their longing for an identity that transcended national borders. This erosion of trust stemmed, in part, from the way Arab liberation movements were contained—diverted by the opening of external warfronts—and the subsequent imposition of a perpetual state of emergency. This cultivated a general climate of fear and led to the people’s ultimate surrender to authoritarian rulers.",
      des10: "Thus, it became easy for Islamist movements to stoke the psychological need for a historic victory and offer a sense of identity that could replace the failed Arab nationalist dream. In doing so, they encouraged people to forsake their Arab identity in favour of a broader religious affiliation.",
      des11: "It is high time for these nations to confront the reality before them, abandon collective identities, and embrace the primacy of the individual in order to reclaim a wider space for freedom. Progress will then be achieved through the emancipation of individuals within a broader societal context. No one can offer others what they themselves lack. Individual fulfilment and self-sufficiency are essential prerequisites to attaining this vision.",
      des12: "Let us now consider another factor that aided the rise of Islamists: the double standards and double-speak adopted by many Western governments. On the one hand, they boast of democratic values and profess an unwavering commitment to human rights; on the other, they sustain alliances with authoritarian regimes that share their strategic interests. For instance, while the West—and particularly the United States—frequently condemns human rights abuses, little is said about the violations perpetrated by their close allies, such as the Saudi royal family, which rules its people with an iron fist.",
      des13: "Saudi Arabia is by no means the sole violator of human rights in the world. I focus on it here because it is the epicentre of Islamist ideology and the primary financial backer of movements seeking to Islamise Arab and other societies alike.",
      des14: "In my view, it is impossible to stem the tide of fundamentalist Islamism without a decisive stance from the West. There must be an end to the unchecked power and influence of its autocratic allies. These regimes must be isolated, and all diplomatic ties with them—Saudi Arabia foremost among them—must be unequivocally severed.",
      des15: "Now is the moment for the West—and for us—to place our trust in the younger generations who are demanding change. They are the new artisans of destiny. The young men and women of Tunisia and Egypt have demonstrated the merit of that trust by overcoming not only their dictators but also the passivity of their own intellectuals. They have emerged as the true thought leaders of the Arab world—educators to those still perched upon rhetorical thrones and clinging to outdated expressions and ideas disconnected from the lived realities of their societies. These young revolutionaries have also managed to surprise Western politicians and disrupt their long-standing arrogance and illusion of control over the destinies of others.",
      des16: "This article summarises a symposium (held on 9 February 2011) in which I participated alongside several speakers at the Société de la Presse Française. In my intervention, I explored the close relationship between oppressive regimes and the rise of Islamist movements throughout the Arab world. I also explained how these regimes managed to survive by persuading Western governments that their stability served as the last defence against the further spread of Islamism."

      des1: "Now that the Tunisian anti-power virus has begun to take effect, it must swiftly seek vaccines to counter smaller, emerging viruses disguised in religious thought. In doing so, this nascent new consciousness may discover a viable path towards life.",
      des2: "There is little doubt that Tunisian society possesses a robust immune system capable of resisting the trap of religious delirium. This immunity and predisposition may stem from various factors, foremost among them a fifty-year foundation built on a system relatively close to Western secularism. Let us not forget that Tunisian women have, for a long time, enjoyed civil rights and liberties still denied to their counterparts in virtually all other Arab nations. This fact alone has fortified the country’s resistance to the religious infectious fungus.",
      des3: "Tunisia’s battle is not yet over. The struggle for life—and the struggle of life—continues. Yet, it has already succeeded in exporting its triumph over the invisible frontiers of fear to other Arab states. The Tunisian domino has toppled into Egypt, despite the significant differences between the two, not least Egypt’s vulnerability to organised Islamic thought, deeply entrenched within its social fabric and openly seeking to extend its influence and seize political power. Despite these setbacks, we must support revolutionary movements regardless of their ultimate outcomes—and prepare ourselves for any potential assault from the religious virus.",
      des4: "Before we ask what might come next, or contemplate the unknown destinies of angry crowds, we must turn our attention to more immediate and visible threats. These revolts are unfolding within a climate of heightened religious sentiment. Islamic movements will not hesitate to seize upon the opportunity to ride the wave of popular protest. In that regard, they are no different from leeches feeding on the blood of the people. They are no different from the tyrants of the region. They will exchange guarantees of safety and dignity for ethereal promises, with no earthly assets, only threats of punishment in the hereafter for anyone who dares reclaim their lost self.",
      des5: "Perhaps the time has come for diverse forces—regardless of creed or conviction—to unite under a shared desire and vision for an earthly future. Perhaps now is the time to draw up a carefully considered strategy to confront and contain religious thought, without hesitation or compromise.",
      des6: "It does not matter whether we share identical visions or solutions. What matters is the ultimate aim that unites all of humanity. As the Buddhists put it, 'We may take different roads to reach the mountain top, but once we arrive, we see all paths from the same vantage.'",
      des7: "This is why I believe our foremost concern must be the construction of a new social and economic programme—one that places the interests of individuals above all else, and then considers the collective good beyond religious or ethnic allegiances. Such a programme may prove to be the best safeguard against the rigid Islamic cancer fuelled by Saudi oil money.",
      des8: "There is no denying that many factors have allowed this deeply entrenched cancer to take root in the minds of wretched, hungry peoples who have long suffered from war, colonisation and oppression—and who now face a gaping intellectual void that religion fills with saccharine dreams and promises.",
      des9: "Equally undeniable is the organisational prowess of Islamist groups. They are skilled in recruitment and in exploiting the psychological wounds of these long-oppressed societies to advance their own agendas—and those of their religious leaders, who are the primary beneficiaries of such social structures. Naturally, these organisations flourish under the shadow of authoritarian and corrupt states that have robbed their people of every liberty and left them only with ruins and economic collapse. The combination of all these conditions has rendered the region a fertile ground for the cultivation of religious poison.",
      des10: "It is all too easy for these organisations to cloak themselves in the garb of purity, virtue and righteousness—deceiving nations with hollow promises of a brighter tomorrow. They rekindle illusions of a bygone Islamic golden age, an era of bounty, affluence and bliss. Dreamers are promised an empty triumph over all adversity.",
      des11: "These religious-political movements possess a masterful understanding of how to strike the right psychological chord. They know precisely how to stir individuals and exploit the immense yearning for psychological redemption—after centuries of historical defeat.",
      des12: "I believe it is imperative to expose how history is being twisted and misrepresented. We must shine a light on the true causes of this much-lauded 'Islamic awakening', which was not born of the cultural heritage of the Arabian Peninsula. The achievements attributed to the Umayyads and Abbasids were in fact the result of centuries of diverse civilisational amalgamation across the Middle East and beyond—including Egypt—long before the rise of Islam.",
      des13: "This so-called awakening was therefore not a product of Islam alone, but a result of rich cultural intermixing. As we know, religion is a cultural product—it cannot transcend the norms and values of the environment that births it.",
      des14: "Fundamentalist Islamist thought has succeeded in recruiting a core of marginalised individuals and reviving the memory of jihad in the minds of the vulnerable—forming a chorus of suicidal souls, eager to kill and be killed. While suicide may remain an individual act, a ‘choice’, claiming the right to kill is unequivocally a crime against humanity.",
      des15: "To counter this notion, we must make peace with the idea of death—when life is rendered unbearable. In the shadows of cruelty and deprivation, we must revisit the ancient wisdom of the Japanese samurai, who, when faced with crisis and forced to weigh life against death, would choose death with clarity and courage.",
      des16: "Once we conquer the fear of death, we can face all obstacles to life with greater resolve. We must adopt flexible strategies, adaptable to ever-shifting contexts and realities.",
      des17: "I strongly believe in a strategy built upon organisation, willpower, dexterity, and an astute choice of discourse that speaks to the psyche of our societies with intellectual suppleness and a readiness to act beyond the confines of ego. These are the most effective tactics to rein in the Islamists.",
      des18: "Let me close with the words of the Chinese military strategist Sun Tzu: 'Victory and defeat are not the result of pure chance, nor of divine intervention. They are the outcome of choice—the choice of one strategy over another. Sound strategic foundations can only lead to victory.'"

      description: "An analysis of authoritarianism, fear, and uprising in the Arab world, using Tunisia's revolution as a turning point.",
      des1: "For decades, Arab regimes have succeeded in numbing the collective consciousness of their peoples through a range of tactics: repression, violence, exile—whether abroad or beneath the soil—and the systematic marginalisation of those who remained on the land. All this has served one ultimate goal: the entrenchment of absolute power. In pursuit of this goal, these governments have deliberately silenced knowledge and stifled information that runs counter to the principle of domination, preventing it from reaching the public domain.",
      des2: "At the root of this insatiable urge to dominate and subjugate lies a fragile ego—an anxious self, lost in its own narrow corridors. It is an ego impoverished in knowledge, famished for biological and psychological gratification, and too weak to find its place within the collective.",
      des3: "These regimes suffer from a form of political neurosis, projecting onto the world the drama of their internal disarray. They draw upon their cultural surroundings to construct an illusory heroic archetype, one they graft onto their own deficient sense of self—an ego incapable of dialogue or exchange with others. As a result, they constantly require conflict, whether internal or—if geography and geopolitics allow—external, to assert their dominance and tighten their grip on those beneath their rule.",
      des4: "Despotism often enlists the beast of religious fundamentalism, subtly and strategically. It is deployed as needed—a weapon of fear, a brittle stick used to bludgeon opponents.",
      des5: "Arab regimes, without exception, have played a significant role in nurturing Islamic fundamentalist movements. Cloaked in a superficial secularism, they deceive themselves into believing in a legitimacy they once seized by force.",
      des6: "Thus, those who live under ignorant, hypocritical regimes—regimes that feed religious fundamentalism—are right to rebel. It is a right as basic as survival itself. And if the cost of breaking free from authoritarianism must be a period of fundamentalist rule, that cost is no greater than the deathlike stillness these embalmed regimes have imposed upon us.",
      des7: "Better that we prepare ourselves, however grim the next phase may be, than to be dragged into it unprepared—from one form of death to another, more insidious. Iraq offers a cautionary tale.",
      des8: "Once the wall of fear is broken—even just once—new uprisings become not only possible but inevitable. Fear loses its grip with each blow struck against it.",
      des9: "The Tunisian uprising is the convulsion of a body on the verge of death—lashing out to shatter death’s grip, reclaiming the right to live, and rejecting the quietude of the grave. It is the collective will refusing to vanish.",
      des10: "When the conditions for a dignified life are stripped away, when the individual is reduced to a passive recipient—a scapegoat for the nourishment of a tyrannical ego—then the gamble of change becomes not only an act of hope, but a necessary step. Such a leap demands the annihilation of fear: the fear of the unknown, the fear of the Islamist spectre.",
      des11: "Perhaps these societies must pass through the dark tunnel of religious fundamentalism, fall into the claws of the monster, and emerge with newfound immunity. The encounter may serve as a kind of vaccine—preparing them for future battles against authoritarian viruses, whether embodied in clergy or crowned in thrones.",
      des12: "We all dream of personal freedoms—of a life where individuals can sing their own songs freely. But this is only possible when ownership of the self is restored—when the individual regains the right to live and to die. Only then can the imagination begin to soar, wandering unbound. This rebirth of imagination must be preceded by individual fulfilment; only through it can we transcend the collective’s cognitive boundaries and take flight, a bird traversing all cultures.",
      des13: "To reach such a place, we must undertake a conscious act of resuscitation—of both the isolated individual and the suffocating reality that encircles them. They must be freed from the narrow confines that rob them of breath.",
      des14: "From this perspective, no one who holds freedom as their highest goal can lend support to any authority that represses the self or shackles the imagination under the pretext of fighting the “other devil” of religious fundamentalism.",
      des15: "Many societies—including Arab ones—are plagued by neurotic anxieties, especially the fear of religious extremism. To overcome such disorders and uproot authoritarian thought at its core, we must confront what we fear. Only by facing it can we dissolve the deep-seated mental images infused with accumulated dread of the unknown.",
      des16: "Turning to the “coping” theory proposed by Folkman and Lazarus—which helps us understand how individuals behave within their environments—we find that people are not passive before external demands. Rather, they actively engage with their surroundings, interpreting events and developing strategies to adapt. Some of these strategies focus on solving the problem directly; others address the underlying conditions that give rise to it.",
      des17: "Rebellion, then, in all its forms, is the individual’s positive declaration of selfhood—an eruption after all strategies of accommodation and quiet change have failed.",
      des18: "Every moment of despair contains the seed of hope. Death and life are deeply intertwined; there is no life without death, no light without darkness.",
      des19: "The people of Tunisia, in an instinctive, uncoordinated surge, chose to return to life. They rose up against their bloodsuckers, defying the fear of death in order to live again. They took the first step towards reviving awareness and embracing the spirit of risk and rebellion in the face of the unknown—perhaps offering a living example to other societies paralysed by fear, resigned to their artificial respirators, and reluctant to change."

        description: "Mohamed Bouazizi’s spontaneous act of defiance against the degrading conditions in his society—and the wave of strikes and protests it ignited across Tunisia—marks a defining moment. It reminds us that, at times, death can become the threshold for a new beginning: the inception of a life project born out of rupture.",
        des2: "What is unfolding in Tunisia today is not merely a reaction—it is the first glimmer of consciousness after a long coma. A lucid recognition of deprivation, and a deliberate choice to resist in pursuit of dignity, fulfilment, and sufficiency. It is the awakening of a society long resigned to silence.",
        des3: "Bouazizi’s case is not an anomaly. It reflects a collective condition endured by countless young men and women across the Arab world. It is the paralysis that comes with powerlessness, the erosion of even the most basic individual freedoms under regimes that know only the language of domination—where life and death are weaponised in equal measure.",
        des4: "When freedom becomes intertwined with death, when the homeland begins to resemble an earthly hell—a vision not far removed from the believer’s imagined inferno—it becomes clear that life has ceased to be long before any true journey of exploration or meaning could begin. And it is precisely that journey—towards meaning—that fuels life.",
        des5: "Many of us cling to life despite its misery, accepting subjugation, self-effacement, and withdrawal. Our demands are reduced to satisfying the most primal needs, and the individual becomes trapped in a condition lower than that of animals—who, at the very least, live in harmony with nature. This compels us to re-evaluate the foundational meaning of life. Perhaps, then, we might rise—if only marginally—to the level of creatures that live with balance and instinctual coherence.",
        des6: "For centuries, humanity has wrestled with the fear of death by constructing fantasies of an illusory eternity, forgetting to harness its inner forces to seek fulfilment in this life. In this process, earthly life was replaced by the promise of eternal life—a compensatory illusion. And just as one approaches fulfilment and begins to acquire greater freedom, they retreat into this illusion, surrendering instead to the comfort of death.",
        des7: "It is from here that we must examine the state of the individual in Arab societies, crushed beneath the weight of an unholy trinity: a wrathful God, a tyrannical ruler, and a repressive society. The suffering of individuals in such contexts mirrors, in many ways, the believers’ vision of hell. So we are right to ask: what does life mean for those who are denied its very pleasures?",
        des8: "I remain convinced that life and freedom are inextricably bound. They converge at the point of knowledge, the freedom to choose, and the acceptance of responsibility. While our awareness is often shaped by the values imposed by our environment, we retain the capacity to derive new ideas from diverse sources—ideas that allow us to choose, reject, or transform prevailing norms. From such autonomy, genuine responsibility emerges.",
        des9: "This autonomy, however, can only be born from an individual process of fulfilment—beginning with the satisfaction of primal needs, and gradually evolving within a social framework that offers rewards to encourage the individual’s participation and integration.",
        des10: "It is these rewards that compel individuals to embrace collective values, work to perpetuate them, and even sacrifice in their name. But when such rewards vanish, so too do the meanings and values the collective once instilled. Without them, life loses coherence—especially when the collective exercises total control, extinguishing the last refuge of individuality: the imagination.",
        des11: "At this point, the individual loses all internal motivation to pursue fulfilment or sufficiency. As Henri Laborit observed, “Satisfaction can only be attained through an act of fulfilment. When fulfilment becomes impossible, crisis ensues—manifesting as violence when it affects an individual, or as revolution when it affects a broader class.”",
        des12: "For this reason, I believe it is legitimate—indeed essential—to re-examine the meaning of life and death within Arab societies, where even the right to meet one’s basic needs is absent. Can life be defended when its primary engine—desire, drive, fulfilment—has been severed?",
        des13: "To my mind, what separates life from death is precisely the awareness of both—and of freedom. Life, without fragments of freedom, becomes void. It is the consciousness of one’s condition, and the freedom to choose a path towards fulfilment, that give life its worth.",
        des14: "This is why, in some circumstances, suicide aligns more closely with the principle of life than with its negation—especially when it emerges under the weight of authoritarianism, ideological suffocation, or a religious order that throttles human fulfilment. In such contexts, choosing death becomes an act of rebirth—for others—and a moment of clarity and liberation for the individual.",
        des15: "It is well known that the collective invented the illusion of security to draw the individual into its fold. It has also devised countless mechanisms—varying from society to society—depending on how much freedom it permits. The collective will always innovate new tools to preserve its dominance, for every social system is ultimately a closed system, circulating information and values within its own orbit.",
        des16: "Yet we must understand the primary driving force behind these systems: fulfilment first, then the hope of sufficiency, both arranged within a rigid hierarchy. When both are absent, the individual remains trapped in a state of perpetual torment, suspended between life and death.",
        des17: "This is the condition of all individuals living under authoritarianism in its various forms across the Arab world. And that is why we must honour every act—whether personal or collective—that seeks liberation, even if we disagree with the methods employed."

      description: "In order to act effectively against all that obstructs the path of progress and paralyses modern intelligence, we must collectively strive for a better understanding of the roots of ignorant and regressive thought. Residual ideas inherited from bygone centuries—ideas that hurl us back to prehistoric times—must be identified and discredited. This pursuit of understanding is not driven by a desire to respect these beliefs, but rather by the necessity to expose their savage origins and explain the extent to which they remain an entangled, confused snarl in the minds of individuals and groups who continue to uphold them.",
        des2: "Such was the stance of archaeologist and historian Salomon Reinach, who devoted his life’s work to dispelling the mists of residual beliefs across cultures. I took the liberty, in the paragraph above, of paraphrasing this idea from his voluminous study Cultes, mythes et religions (1905–1923). This serves as our entry point into the central theme of this article: an inquiry into the origins of the idea of god.",
        des3: "A careful examination of anthropological research and studies on the origins of myth enables us to uncover the deep roots of religion and the belief systems that predate the emergence of the god-concept. These pagan beliefs ought not to be dissociated from the history of religions, for they constituted fertile ground for their birth and growth. If, at their origin, religions fed upon and evolved from the infantile and naïve imagination of early civilisations, they later acquired strength and eventually imposed themselves as powerful authorities over hearts and minds.",
        des4: "The notion of a primitive god finds its source in the concept of the totem. Many anthropologists agree on the universality of the totemic system, which was by no means limited to the native populations of Australia and the Americas.",
        des5: "Let us begin with a brief overview of the totemic system itself. It is a tribal structure grounded in a series of taboos, which may be summarised—according to Durkheim, Reinach, Frazer and others—as practices centred around the veneration of a chosen animal, or in rare instances, a plant or specific inanimate object.",
        des6: "The totem, at its core, rests upon an elusive and enigmatic contract based on shared beliefs between a particular group of people and the animals under their guardianship. Reinach observed that the totemic system arose alongside archaic Homo sapiens. This early veneration of the totem animal waned and eventually disappeared as human societies transitioned from the hunter-gatherer phase to agriculture and sedentary life.",
        des7: "Studies examining this shift have identified strikingly similar traits and processes across cultures and civilisations, from ancient Greece to Egypt and Syria. Within the totemic system, the tribal animal is designated as an object of prohibition. It may only be killed on a specific day of the year, and always in the presence of the entire tribe. Special ceremonies and rituals—marked by scenes of mourning and grief—accompany the slaughter of the totem animal.",
        des8: "A close reading of the reports compiled by Spencer and Gillen on the subject of totemism highlights some of its direct consequences, such as the emergence of exogamy and the gradual prohibition of incest. Reinach also noted that, in some civilisations, the later emergence of the personified god was accompanied by human sacrifice intended to resurrect and renew life. These practices trace their origins to the sanctity of the totem animal. Frazer’s work on tribal traditions—many of which survive today as rituals stripped of their original emotional significance—shows that such rituals were grounded in the belief that supernatural powers were transferred to the human who consumed the totem animal’s flesh. From an anthropological standpoint, these rites were underpinned by the idea that the flesh of the totem animal—the tribe’s protector—bestowed extraordinary powers upon the consumer. Remnants of this belief can still be found today in various cultures. In certain regions of China, for example, the genitals of specific animals are consumed in the belief that they enhance sexual potency.",
        des9: "It is worth reminding readers that, for the Māori, male genitals symbolise life, whereas female genitals represent death. In some Chinese traditions, the consumption of male animal genitals is likewise associated with vitality and energy. Here, we must underline the dialectical relationship between internal psychological drives and the external experiences that led many societies to adopt such beliefs.",
        des10: "One may draw some consolation from the thought that early humans’ ignorance of the biological mechanisms of reproduction led them to develop notions of reincarnation through animals and plants. The earliest hypothesis explaining the development of totemism rests on the idea of a continuous flow of life between humans and their totem animals. The totem animal was considered a full member of the tribe and endowed with sacred qualities.",
        des11: "Yet from this original sacred regard for the totem animal, we eventually moved to indiscriminate and collective slaughter. The killing of the totem animal was not seen as a sacrifice to any deity—for the simple reason that the concept of god had not yet been born.",
        des12: "The notion of sacrifice to the gods emerged gradually, alongside humanity’s slow progression from savagery to agrarian life. With this shift, animals began to lose their sacred aura, and more significantly, humans began to develop feelings of revulsion towards certain creatures.",
        des13: "If we consult the writings of Robertson Smith and Salomon Reinach on the sacralisation of animals among the ancient peoples of Greece, Rome, Syria and Egypt, we find, for instance, that wild boars were considered sacred in ancient Syria. This may shed light on the origin of the prohibition against pork among Jews and Muslims, both of whom originally lived in that part of the world. The emotions and affects originally associated with the sanctity of the animal gradually inverted, yet the notion of prohibition persisted. It is important to note that feelings of disgust and hatred can, at times, serve as necessary tools to sever our emotional connection to the original sacred significance of the totem animal.",

The discussion examines the origins of the taboo and its transformation from survival mechanisms to moral and legal codes, with a special focus on how totemism, blood ties, and guilt have shaped human societies and religious practices.",
     des1: "In a previous article, I began my exploration of the origins of the totem. In this second part, I will turn to a closely related subject: the question of the taboo—a notion intimately tied to the earliest human reactions to fatal natural phenomena.",
     des2: "Let us begin with a brief glance at the process by which individual inferences are abstracted into sweeping generalisations. We know that these personal inferences consist of a composite of cognitive images lodged in long-term memory. These images retain the emotional and affective charge present when the original inferences were made. At a later stage, the brain reorganises images with shared attributes stored in the latent memory, and these re-emerge in the form of actual behaviour.",
     des3: "Undoubtedly, each one of us perceives reality through the lens of our individual imagination, the quality of which varies according to our experiences. What distinguishes a conscious individual—one who seeks to enrich their knowledge and understanding—from another who remains shackled to imposed experiences is this: the desire to expand one’s imagination through science and knowledge, rather than yielding to the consequences of ignorance and sweeping generalisations.",
     des4: "Primitive humans instinctively prohibited that which they did not understand, as a means of avoiding danger—an entirely rational survival response. The taboo did not arise from an individual or collective intent to regulate social life. For this reason, in its early stages, the taboo was not associated with punishment meted out by the group to those who violated it. Rather, it was believed that the taboo itself could bring about death to anyone who touched or approached it, whether deliberately or inadvertently.",
     des5: "The taboo did not denote an action; instead, it implied prohibition in a fundamental sense—it acted not as a motivator, but as a restraint. This is the key distinction between the taboo and the later emergence of religious laws, which transformed the original meaning of taboo into systems of moral and legal codes. The affects and psychological states of fear and dread underpin the rise of the taboo, which functioned as a totalising and uniform explanation for all recurring phenomena caused by the natural world.",
     des6: "Let us return to the relationship between primitive humans and nature. While today we might regard this bond as a sign of philosophical or ecological advancement, it did not stem from any conscious recognition that humans formed part of nature, nor from any sense of harmony with other living beings. Rather, it was rooted in psychological states shaped by a deep sense of powerlessness and lack of control over the forces of nature.",
     des7: "There is no doubt that the human need for many ancient myths and fables has waned over time. Perhaps humanity simply grew weary of repeating the same failed experiences, eventually realising that rituals grounded in sorcery and shamanism had not succeeded in mastering the external world (what we now refer to as the external or empirical experience). When this external experience clashes with inner consciousness, a confused mind—unable to resolve the consequences of this confrontation between inner and outer forces—often defaults to supernatural interpretations.",
     des8: "Historical records offer numerous examples of how, during the post-agricultural and pastoral stages of evolution, humans used animals to detect danger or locate water sources. These early humans may have come to recognise the keenness of animal senses. The Roman historian Tacitus, for instance, observed that ancient Jews venerated donkeys, referencing a tale in which a wild variant of this animal led Moses to a water spring. In the same account, Tacitus offers insight into the sacrificial ritual involving a calf—seen as an act of vengeance against the ancient Egyptians, who revered the sacred bull Apis.",
     des9: "From this, we may trace the roots of the totemic system to the very regions in which the Abrahamic religions would later arise. The totemic structure evolved alongside each stage of human development, from hunting and gathering to agriculture and settled farming.",
     des10: "Returning to the notion of taboo and its connection with totemism, we must consider its profound influence on the Abrahamic faiths. The taboo was defined by the prohibition of contact with the sacred totem. In some ancient tribes, and as noted by Durkheim, a woman who had just given birth was considered a taboo object for forty days due to the presence of blood—believed to be the essence or spirit of life.",
     des11: "Here, we encounter a link with the notion of blood ties, which continue to underpin tribal loyalties and emotional allegiances. This association between taboo and blood offers a vital clue to the concept of the primitive god. Even today, menstrual and postpartum blood remain subjects of prohibition in many Muslim cultures, where women are not permitted to pray or fast during such periods.",
     des12: "And since we are on the subject of women, it is worth mentioning the Roman pagan tradition of whipping women with rods—an ancient ritual that endured until at least the 5th century and coincides, in modern times, with Valentine’s Day. On the fifteenth day of the second month, young men (and later priests) would roam the streets of Ancient Rome with rods, flogging women they encountered. It was believed that such flagellation promoted fertility.",
     des13: "This practice was not confined to the Roman Lupercalia festival but echoes other traditions recorded by anthropologists like Thompson, Frazer, and Reinach, where animals were flogged to enhance their reproductive capabilities. Given the deep entrenchment of taboo in the fabric of social organisation, it is important to consider how its meaning has shifted over the centuries, and how its influence continues in laws governing punishment and moral codes.",
     des14: "Transgressors of the taboo were seen as contaminated, and punishment served to prevent that contamination from spreading to the wider group. This fear of contagion became the primary catalyst for the emergence of guilt within human societies, linking closely with the idea of purification and the expiation of sin. In the Akakios tribe in Africa, sinners undergo rigorous rituals to rid themselves of guilt. They confess to the tribal sorcerer, who oversees a ceremony beginning with the sinner vomiting—a symbolic purging of inner corruption.",
     des15: "This association between the physical act of emptying the body and the spiritual notion of cleansing suggests that guilt was once conceived as a corporeal affliction, not a matter of conscience. Here again, we encounter the concept of the scapegoat: rather than punishing the guilty party, an innocent animal is sacrificed to redeem the sin.",
     des16: "The scapegoat motif appears in many societies that pre-date the Abrahamic religions. Plutarch recounts a public punishment in the city of Chaeronea in which a slave’s genitals were whipped while his tormentors cried: ‘Depart from our city, oh famine, and come to us, oh health and plenty!’ Though these customs may seem absurd to us today, they emerged during the agricultural phase of human evolution.",
     des17: "Totemic remnants were gradually transformed into spiritual doctrines, evolving into ideas of divine punishment and reward, and manifesting in religious rituals—from scapegoating to collective prayer for rain. Climate, too, played a crucial role in maintaining these totemic beliefs. More significantly, however, we find that the natural and cultural environment continues to reinforce them.",
     des18: "In societies where basic needs and desires are met, the longing for deeper understanding tends to flourish. The fulfilment of biological necessities often paves the way for a more vibrant and inquisitive intellectual life."

Was I fleeing from grief, from finality? Or was I simply placing myself above all else? I do not know…`,
        des3: "But I do know that I have done it again—with you. I returned to Syria a month before your death, yet I left you once more. Was it something in my blood, an instinct to escape? Or do I carry a detachment that even I do not fully understand? Perhaps… I will find no answer until my own final moments—only then will I know what you both felt when your children were absent.",
        des4: "And I do not know why I write these words. Am I confessing my failures, declaring to the world that I was a daughter who never truly thought of you? Or am I simply trying to release the weight that chokes me? Perhaps I am just someone incapable of keeping emotions locked within, needing to declare to all: I am who I am.",
        des5: "Nothing has stripped me of my strength as your absence has. Nothing has left me so exposed to my sorrow as your passing has. I know you devoted yourself to others, but I am certain that our distance caused you sadness—even if you never admitted it, even if you refused to acknowledge it. And I know, too, that we all disappointed you. You had every right to feel that way. For had my own daughter done to me what I did to you, I would have felt the same.",
        des6: "At night, when I struggle to sleep despite the breathing exercises and techniques that no longer work, my mind drifts far away. I stare into the void, drowning in memories of all those I have loved—you among them. And I admit that I was harsh with you—or perhaps harshness has simply become a part of me. I search for you, for all those I have loved and lost, within the corridors of my mind, which still clings to your memory and theirs. No doubt you are present now with greater intensity because your departure is the most recent, while my memory pushes away those who left long ago. I wonder in silence: Can you hear me, wherever you are? But reason whispers back: There is no one there to listen.",
        des7: "All I have left of you are memories and the image of your face in my mind, just like those who passed before you. I will carry your memory like an ember in my heart—painful, yet the only thing that keeps me close to you. No other world will reunite us, but you will remain alive within me, an eternal presence that will stay with me for the rest of my days.My only solace is knowing that you are free from pain.",
        des8: "And so, I write—not to seek redemption, nor to be absolved of what I cannot change, but simply because silence is unbearable.",

The Russia-hosted Syrian National Dialogue Congress in Sochi may pave the way to the resolution of the Syrian crisis, Randa Kassis, the leader of the “Astana platform” of the Syrian opposition, has told Sputnik, highlighting the necessity of the creation of the constitutional commission during the ongoing summit to facilitate the peace process.`,
        des2: `Those who have come to the Syrian National Dialogue Congress in the Russian resort city of Sochi are motivated by patriotism and responsibility for the future of their country, Randa Kassis, the leader of the “Astana platform” of the Syrian opposition, told Sputnik Arabic, slamming those who snubbed the summit.`,
        des3: `“Anyone who refused to participate in the Sochi congress is irresponsible,” the politician highlighted.`,
        des4:`According to Kassis, all the members of her delegation understand that the Syrian crisis could not be resolved under the aegis of the United States. The Syrians have to kick-start the process themselves, here, in Sochi, she stressed.`,
        des5:`
“We must continue to work despite numerous difficulties faced by the Syrian opposition,” the politician said. “We must do everything to ensure the success of the Sochi talks.”`,
        des6:`
Kassis underscored that President Vladimir Putin's initiative to hold the Syrian National Dialogue Congress in Sochi is an important step, which, unfortunately, was not accepted by some political figures.`,
        des7:`“If Vladimir Putin initiated something, it means not just the intention to do something, but the implementation of the objectives,” she pointed out. “Therefore, I pin my hopes on the event and this is why we arrived in Sochi.”`,
        des8:`
The politician emphasized that she had made efforts to gather as many representatives of the Syrian opposition as possible to form a working group. “We need to start finding the way out of the crisis immediately. I believe that it is impossible without the creation of a new constitution,” she noted.`,
        des9:`
Speaking to Sputnik, Kassis shed light on the Astana platform’s plans and program. The politician emphasized the necessity to create a “constitutional commission” within the framework of the negotiations.`,
        des10:`
“We need to start working on a new Syrian constitution,” she said. “We have prepared our own draft constitution, on which we have spent a year working on.”`,
        des11:`According to the politician one of the most important issues concerning the future Syrian constitution is the maintenance of a secular state: “To clarify this issue I offered the following [definition]: the secularism is defined by the state’s neutrality to religious or non-religious beliefs of a Syrian citizen,” she said, “Beliefs could be not only religious, it could be views or a position and a person should have freedom [to express them].”`,
        des12:`
The present Syrian constitution offers four options to define a Syrian citizen’s religious beliefs: Sunni Muslim, Druze, Orthodox or Catholic Christian. Kassis explained that for ordinary Syrians the matters of marriages and inheritance are closely connected with their religious beliefs and existing state laws.
`,
        des13:`
She noted that “in order to overcome the potential difficulties” she proposes “to introduce the fifth category — “a Syrian citizen” — without any religious references.`,
        des14:`“It is necessary to give the Syrians the freedom of choice. A person may prefer to live in an exclusively secular legal field,” Kassis suggested.`,
        des15:`On January 30 the Syrian national dialogue congress officially opened in Sochi. The summit has brought together various opposition and pro-governmental forces, as well as representatives of the country’s numerous ethnic and religious groups in order to facilitate the peace process with the focus on the Syrian constitution and elections.`,
        des16:`
The UN Security Council permanent members as well as Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Lebanon and Saudi Arabia were also invited to participate in the event as observers. However, a number of states including the US and France, refused to attend, as did the Syrian Negotiation Commission (SNC) opposition group.`,

Meeting between Beibut Atamkulov, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Kazakhstan, Randa Kassis, President of the Astana Platform, and Fabien Baussart, President of CPFA, in the presence of Deputy Minister Roman Vassilenko and Aidarbek Tumatov, Director of the Middle East. 
They had a friendly and fruitful discussion, where they spoke about the crisis in Syria and the need to achieve peace negotiated in respect for plurality.
Fabien Baussart noted the crucial and historic role of President N. Nazarbayev in the fight against nuclear non-proliferation since the 1990s.
Randa Kassis thanked President Nazarbayev and Kazakhstan for agreeing to initiate political talks in 2015, after the appeal she launched, and for hosting negotiations at the end of 2016.
Kazakhstan’s contribution to peace has been paramount.`,

Opposition groups held multiple meetings in Riyadh to decide who would attend the talks. And the international community repeatedly debated the fate of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, all in anticipation of negotiations that were scheduled to begin in January.

Those talks were delayed once but have now begun. But without main members of the opposition.

I remember being five or six years old, exploring myself with innocent curiosity, only to discover something I had been conditioned to believe was impure. My instinct was to cleanse, to rid myself of what I thought was dirt. But that act, simple and instinctive, was also my first conscious rejection of an imposed taboo.

There, that I grasped the nature of power—how it operates, how it can be resisted.

It happened in the schoolyard, a place that, for many children, is merely a setting for games and lessons, but for me, it became an early battlefield. A group of boys, emboldened by their own sense of entitlement, sought to intimidate me. I refused to shrink. When one of them made his move, I retaliated. I knocked him to the ground, but that act of defiance came at a price. The boys turned on me, pelting me with stones.",
        des6: "The pain was real, but it wasn’t what left a mark on me. What I remember most vividly isn’t the pain—it’s the realisation that fear is a weapon. And I could choose not to carry it.

        des7: "I charged toward one of the boys, grabbed a stone larger than the ones they had thrown, and raised it high. For a brief second, I hesitated. Did I truly intend to strike? Or was it enough that they believed I would? I will never know the answer. What I do know is that in that moment, the balance of power changed. I saw fear flicker in their eyes, and with it, I understood something fundamental: power is an illusion, sustained only by submission. I had refused to submit.",
        des8:`That moment did not just shape how others saw me; it shaped how I saw myself. It changed my place in that school. The girls, who had once been passive observers, now looked to me for protection. The boys, who had sought to put me in my place, now knew I would not be tamed. But beyond that, something deeper had taken root in me. I understood, in a visceral way, that authority—whether in the form of a schoolyard bully or a greater system—was only as strong as our willingness to accept it. That lesson stayed with me. Over time, I distanced myself from all girls who had once followed the script written for them. I questioned religion, society, morality—every structure that sought to define my existence. My father, an agnostic, had instilled in me the value of independent thought, and I took that lesson to its extreme. I rejected all imposed beliefs, seeing them as viruses infecting human minds. My disdain for authority extended beyond the personal to the political, and my involvement in Syria’s revolution was not just a political stance—it was an extension of who I had become.`,

Through these debates, I connected with like-minded individuals such as Kacem El Ghazzali, Waleed Al-Husseini, and many others who, like me, waged an intellectual rebellion against the constraints imposed by religion and tradition.`,
         des10:`My activism wasn’t confined to words—it was action. I helped ex-Muslims escape persecution—providing financially and logistical support, and at times, offering them refuge when they had nowhere else to turn.`,

His presence was a silent symphony, an extension of the philosopher whose name he bore.`,

In those moments, I felt the whisper of freedom—a breeze that stirred me, as if chasing an elusive fragrance. I longed to immerse myself in its breath, to feel it brush my face. Yet even in those flashes of vitality, life revealed itself to me as “Thanatos,” a kaleidoscope of memories and meanings intertwined with the faces of the departed. The image of my beloved Nietzsche would often emerge, igniting an ache that nestled deep within my heart.`,

The Russia-hosted Syrian National Dialogue Congress in Sochi may pave the way to the resolution of the Syrian crisis, Randa Kassis, the leader of the “Astana platform” of the Syrian opposition, has told Sputnik, highlighting the necessity of the creation of the constitutional commission during the ongoing summit to facilitate the peace process.

Those who have come to the Syrian National Dialogue Congress in the Russian resort city of Sochi are motivated by patriotism and responsibility for the future of their country, Randa Kassis, the leader of the “Astana platform” of the Syrian opposition, told Sputnik Arabic, slamming those who snubbed the summit.

“Anyone who refused to participate in the Sochi congress is irresponsible,” the politician highlighted.

According to Kassis, all the members of her delegation understand that the Syrian crisis could not be resolved under the aegis of the United States. The Syrians have to kick-start the process themselves, here, in Sochi, she stressed.

“We must continue to work despite numerous difficulties faced by the Syrian opposition,” the politician said. “We must do everything to ensure the success of the Sochi talks.”

Kassis underscored that President Vladimir Putin’s initiative to hold the Syrian National Dialogue Congress in Sochi is an important step, which, unfortunately, was not accepted by some political figures.
“If Vladimir Putin initiated something, it means not just the intention to do something, but the implementation of the objectives,” she pointed out. “Therefore, I pin my hopes on the event and this is why we arrived in Sochi.”

The politician emphasized that she had made efforts to gather as many representatives of the Syrian opposition as possible to form a working group. “We need to start finding the way out of the crisis immediately. I believe that it is impossible without the creation of a new constitution,” she noted.

Speaking to Sputnik, Kassis shed light on the Astana platform’s plans and program. The politician emphasized the necessity to create a “constitutional commission” within the framework of the negotiations.

“We need to start working on a new Syrian constitution,” she said. “We have prepared our own draft constitution, on which we have spent a year working on.”

According to the politician one of the most important issues concerning the future Syrian constitution is the maintenance of a secular state: “To clarify this issue I offered the following [definition]: the secularism is defined by the state’s neutrality to religious or non-religious beliefs of a Syrian citizen,” she said, “Beliefs could be not only religious, it could be views or a position and a person should have freedom [to express them].”
The present Syrian constitution offers four options to define a Syrian citizen’s religious beliefs: Sunni Muslim, Druze, Orthodox or Catholic Christian. Kassis explained that for ordinary Syrians the matters of marriages and inheritance are closely connected with their religious beliefs and existing state laws.

She noted that “in order to overcome the potential difficulties” she proposes “to introduce the fifth category — “a Syrian citizen” — without any religious references.

“It is necessary to give the Syrians the freedom of choice. A person may prefer to live in an exclusively secular legal field,” Kassis suggested.

On January 30 the Syrian national dialogue congress officially opened in Sochi. The summit has brought together various opposition and pro-governmental forces, as well as representatives of the country’s numerous ethnic and religious groups in order to facilitate the peace process with the focus on the Syrian constitution and elections.

The UN Security Council permanent members as well as Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Lebanon and Saudi Arabia were also invited to participate in the event as observers. However, a number of states including the US and France, refused to attend, as did the Syrian Negotiation Commission (SNC) opposition group.

        description: `This year’s theme is “Let’s Talk Peace!”. The Geneva Peace Talks 2014 will highlight how communication tools, techniques, and channels can contribute to resolving conflict. Speakers will reflect on how they have personally overcome the challenges of communication in their involvements in peacebuilding, communications, peace negotiations, as well as discussions with perpetrators of violence and underrepresented groups to build lasting peace.

Coming from violent and divided environments as well as backgrounds in science, art, business, and more, speakers will share their personal stories of peace and how communication has made a difference in their peacebuilding efforts.

The Geneva Peace Talks are a public event organized on the occasion of the International Day of Peace in a partnership between the United Nations Office at Geneva, Interpeace and the Geneva Peacebuilding Platform.`,

        description: `The relationship between law and religion is an actual and thorny problem, especially in the light of the development, in the Euro-Mediterranean area, of multiple ethical and religious feelings which have generated more and more complex and elaborate, as a result of the relevant migratory flows characterizing the present articulated relations. All this is the result of the relevant migrations which characterize the present situation.

The debate over the space to acknowledge juridical expectations deriving from the encounter/confrontation of different religions and cultures regards, among other issues, international, constitutional, regional and maritime laws.

Starting from theoretical, philosophical and legal considerations, this workshop aims at analyzing the links between the religious and juridical aspects of Mediterranean and European States.

The first session will examine the connection between religion and law in the light of the revolutions in North-African countries, with a special attention to gender and childhood rights.

The second session will be instead dedicated to the analysis of the concepts of pluralism and freedom of worship in the context of European public space, with a special attention to the experiences of several Euro-Mediterranean States, Italy among them.`,
