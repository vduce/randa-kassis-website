    "description": "The individual has long since surrendered to the notion of guardianship. In many societies, from birth, one falls under the authority of one’s parents, only to be subsumed later by society, and then by the state. It is no surprise, then, that one ends up chasing the mirage of a modern-day “hero”—a figure shaped by fantasies and longings—only to fall prey to propaganda."
