The Russia-hosted Syrian National Dialogue Congress in Sochi may pave the way to the resolution of the Syrian crisis, Randa Kassis, the leader of the “Astana platform” of the Syrian opposition, has told Sputnik, highlighting the necessity of the creation of the constitutional commission during the ongoing summit to facilitate the peace process.`,
        des2: `Those who have come to the Syrian National Dialogue Congress in the Russian resort city of Sochi are motivated by patriotism and responsibility for the future of their country, Randa Kassis, the leader of the “Astana platform” of the Syrian opposition, told Sputnik Arabic, slamming those who snubbed the summit.`,
        des3: `“Anyone who refused to participate in the Sochi congress is irresponsible,” the politician highlighted.`,
        des4: `According to Kassis, all the members of her delegation understand that the Syrian crisis could not be resolved under the aegis of the United States. The Syrians have to kick-start the process themselves, here, in Sochi, she stressed.`,
        des5: `
“We must continue to work despite numerous difficulties faced by the Syrian opposition,” the politician said. “We must do everything to ensure the success of the Sochi talks.”`,
        des6: `
Kassis underscored that President Vladimir Putin's initiative to hold the Syrian National Dialogue Congress in Sochi is an important step, which, unfortunately, was not accepted by some political figures.`,
        des7: `“If Vladimir Putin initiated something, it means not just the intention to do something, but the implementation of the objectives,” she pointed out. “Therefore, I pin my hopes on the event and this is why we arrived in Sochi.”`,
        des8: `
The politician emphasized that she had made efforts to gather as many representatives of the Syrian opposition as possible to form a working group. “We need to start finding the way out of the crisis immediately. I believe that it is impossible without the creation of a new constitution,” she noted.`,
        des9: `
Speaking to Sputnik, Kassis shed light on the Astana platform’s plans and program. The politician emphasized the necessity to create a “constitutional commission” within the framework of the negotiations.`,
        des10: `
“We need to start working on a new Syrian constitution,” she said. “We have prepared our own draft constitution, on which we have spent a year working on.”`,
        des11: `According to the politician one of the most important issues concerning the future Syrian constitution is the maintenance of a secular state: “To clarify this issue I offered the following [definition]: the secularism is defined by the state’s neutrality to religious or non-religious beliefs of a Syrian citizen,” she said, “Beliefs could be not only religious, it could be views or a position and a person should have freedom [to express them].”`,
        des12: `
The present Syrian constitution offers four options to define a Syrian citizen’s religious beliefs: Sunni Muslim, Druze, Orthodox or Catholic Christian. Kassis explained that for ordinary Syrians the matters of marriages and inheritance are closely connected with their religious beliefs and existing state laws.
`,
        des13: `
She noted that “in order to overcome the potential difficulties” she proposes “to introduce the fifth category — “a Syrian citizen” — without any religious references.`,
        des14: `“It is necessary to give the Syrians the freedom of choice. A person may prefer to live in an exclusively secular legal field,” Kassis suggested.`,
        des15: `On January 30 the Syrian national dialogue congress officially opened in Sochi. The summit has brought together various opposition and pro-governmental forces, as well as representatives of the country’s numerous ethnic and religious groups in order to facilitate the peace process with the focus on the Syrian constitution and elections.`,
        des16: `
The UN Security Council permanent members as well as Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Lebanon and Saudi Arabia were also invited to participate in the event as observers. However, a number of states including the US and France, refused to attend, as did the Syrian Negotiation Commission (SNC) opposition group.`,

Meeting between Beibut Atamkulov, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Kazakhstan, Randa Kassis, President of the Astana Platform, and Fabien Baussart, President of CPFA, in the presence of Deputy Minister Roman Vassilenko and Aidarbek Tumatov, Director of the Middle East. 
They had a friendly and fruitful discussion, where they spoke about the crisis in Syria and the need to achieve peace negotiated in respect for plurality.
Fabien Baussart noted the crucial and historic role of President N. Nazarbayev in the fight against nuclear non-proliferation since the 1990s.
Randa Kassis thanked President Nazarbayev and Kazakhstan for agreeing to initiate political talks in 2015, after the appeal she launched, and for hosting negotiations at the end of 2016.
Kazakhstan’s contribution to peace has been paramount.`,

Opposition groups held multiple meetings in Riyadh to decide who would attend the talks. And the international community repeatedly debated the fate of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, all in anticipation of negotiations that were scheduled to begin in January.

Those talks were delayed once but have now begun. But without main members of the opposition.

As a child, I was inquisitive—curious about the world, about my body, about the invisible rules that dictated how I should exist within it. I remember being five or six years old, exploring myself with innocent curiosity, only to discover something I had been conditioned to believe was impure. My instinct was to cleanse, to rid myself of what I thought was dirt. But that act, simple and instinctive, was also my first conscious rejection of an imposed taboo.
`,
        des2: "Later, as an adolescent, I repeated the act—not out of naivety, but with full intention. I had no desire for my hymen to be lost through sexual intercourse, for it to be a symbol of virtue or a transaction. I despised its very concept.",

It happened in the schoolyard, a place that, for many children, is merely a setting for games and lessons, but for me, it became an early battlefield. A group of boys, emboldened by their own sense of entitlement, sought to intimidate me. I refused to shrink. When one of them made his move, I retaliated. I knocked him to the ground, but that act of defiance came at a price. The boys turned on me, pelting me with stones.",
        des6: "The pain was real, but it wasn’t what left a mark on me. What I remember most vividly isn’t the pain—it’s the realisation that fear is a weapon. And I could choose not to carry it. I stood there, battered but unbroken, and something shifted within me. I knew that mere defence was not enough. I had to go on the offensive.",
        des7: "I charged toward one of the boys, grabbed a stone larger than the ones they had thrown, and raised it high. For a brief second, I hesitated. Did I truly intend to strike? Or was it enough that they believed I would? I will never know the answer. What I do know is that in that moment, the balance of power changed. I saw fear flicker in their eyes, and with it, I understood something fundamental: power is an illusion, sustained only by submission. I had refused to submit.",
        des8: `That moment did not just shape how others saw me; it shaped how I saw myself. It changed my place in that school. The girls, who had once been passive observers, now looked to me for protection. The boys, who had sought to put me in my place, now knew I would not be tamed. But beyond that, something deeper had taken root in me. I understood, in a visceral way, that authority—whether in the form of a schoolyard bully or a greater system—was only as strong as our willingness to accept it. That lesson stayed with me. Over time, I distanced myself from all girls who had once followed the script written for them. I questioned religion, society, morality—every structure that sought to define my existence. My father, an agnostic, had instilled in me the value of independent thought, and I took that lesson to its extreme. I rejected all imposed beliefs, seeing them as viruses infecting human minds. My disdain for authority extended beyond the personal to the political, and my involvement in Syria’s revolution was not just a political stance—it was an extension of who I had become.`,

It was there that I first saw myself clearly, as though I had been shedding layers all along, waiting for the moment when my true nature would finally emerge. Perhaps my first physical fight with the boys at school had been the catalyst for this change. In that moment, I understood—as did everyone else—that the quiet Syrian Randa no longer existed.

        description: `Algeria was my second birth. It was there that I first saw myself clearly, as though I had been shedding layers all along, waiting for the moment when my true nature would finally emerge. Perhaps my first physical fight with the boys at school had been the catalyst for this change. In that moment, I understood—as did everyone else—that the quiet Syrian Randa no longer existed. Fear had left her, and no authority, no God, could intimidate her again.

        des4: "When I returned to Syria at 12,I rebelled against everyone—authority, the police, and especially the political system. I refused to be enrolled in the Shabiba (Ba’ath Youth), rejecting the indoctrination and slogans forced upon students. I never accepted to be just a number in this country, a cog in the system that dictated how we should think, act, and exist.",
        des5: "Since the age of fourteen, I had engaged my friends in Damascus in debates over the existence of God. Back then, no one dared question religion or the notion of a creator. They labelled me a heretic, believingthat me disregard for social and political order was a direct result ofmy rejection of both God and authority.",

        des6: "At fifteen, my rebellion deepened. I made acquaintances with French employees at the French Cultural Center, where I found an intellectual and cultural connection that was absent amongmy own friends. At the same time, I traveled across Syria with friends my age, engaging in endless debates about God, religions, and the taboos that society tried to impose on us.

        des7: "After my baccalaureate, I went to Germany to study, but I quickly realised that its structured, rigid, and highly organised society did not suit me. It felt too constrained, too predictable, too confining.",
        des8: `There, I met refugees who had fled war—Lebanese, Palestinians—and for the first time, I truly connected with the full scope of Palestinian suffering, beyond the fragments I had heard from my mother, who worked at UNRWA in Damascus, or the stories of resistance I had encountered at school. Photo 14 Photo 15 Photo 16 Photo 17`,
        des9: `I went to Paris, the city I had first fallen in love with at 10 years old, a place that had left an imprint on my mind. Paris had always felt like home—its intellectual vibrancy, its artistic defiance, its embrace of free thought resonated with the spirit of rebellion I carried within me.`,

I was passionate about causes, about ideas, about possibilities, but I also saw the futility in human existence. I oscillated between engagement and nihilism, between building something new and accepting that nothing truly lasts. Death was not something I feared; rather, I saw it as an inevitable release, perhaps even a form of salvation. And maybe that’s why I sought movement, why stability never suited me—I needed to chase moments of fascination before they lost their meaning. Photo 18 Photo 19 Photo 20

        des2: "I met an Israeli young woman, the same age as me, and we became very close. Her life was a tragedy in itself—a mother who had survived the Shoah, a father who refused to acknowledge her, and the wreckage of two failed love stories. Over time, life became increasingly unbearable for her, and depression consumed her until, one day, she chose to surrender herself to death.",
        des3: "The police advised me not to see her body, urging me to keep the memory of her as the beautiful woman I had known. But through her, I began to truly understand both miseries—Palestinian and Israeli. Photo 21 Photo 22 Photo 23 Photo 24",

        des6: "At the beginning of 1994, I started painting. My brother, Jean—one of the greatest contemporary painters in my eyes—was my first inspiration. I was drawn to his creative style, captivated by the raw intensity of his work.",
        des7: "For me, painting was never just a craft; it was an act of defiance—a rebellion against imposed narratives and the rigid expectations of what a woman should be. My work was raw, unfiltered, unapologetic. From the very beginning, my art was a form of resistance, a means to challenge the world as I saw it, to reject the suffocating conventions that sought to dictate how a woman, a body, or an artist should be perceived.",
        des8: `The female form has always been central to my work, but not in the way it’s been commodified for centuries. I refused to depicted it as a passive object of beauty or desire. To me, the body is a battlefield—a paradox, both a prison and a tool of liberation. My brushstrokes were never meant to comfort; they were meant to provoke, to unearth something unsettling, something that forces the viewer to confront their own gaze, their own biases.`,
        des9: `I never cared for perfect symmetry or predictable aesthetics. I paint to merge chaos with structure, to blend dream and reality until the line between them collapses. My canvases don’t tell linear stories—they vibrate, they pulse with contradictions. Critics have said my work feels like music—that it carries its own rhythm. I like that idea. Because art, for me, has always been about breaking silence, shattering complacency.`,
        des10: `I’ve exhibited my work in different places, seen people stare, question, sometimes even recoil. And I embrace that. Art should be unsettling. It should gnaw at something inside you, push you to see beyond the surface.Photo 25 Photo 26 Photo 27 Photo 28`,

        des3: "I drove her to her activities,to seefriends—we traveled together, went out often, even with my own friends. I was never absent from her life.

        des8: `I wrote publicly, encouraged by my elder brother Nabil, who believed in me and in my ability to write. Perhaps I had inherited this gift from my father—the ability to dismantle the dogmas that governed so many aspects of life in the Arab world.`,
        des9: `At the time, platforms like Al Hiwar Al Mutamadin (Civil Discourse) were among the few spaces where secularists, atheists, and free thinkers could engage in meaningful discussions without censorship. Through these debates, I connected with like-minded individuals such as Kacem El Ghazzali, Waleed Al-Husseini, and many others who, like me, waged an intellectual rebellion against the constraints imposed by religion and tradition.`,

By May 2012, I was expelled from the SNC, cast aside by the very movement I had helped build.

The second, later that year, tackled the subject of Islamic Fascism, featuring speakers like Hamed Abdel-Samad and the Moroccan philosopher Said Nachid.

        des8: `Since my withdrawal from political life in 2019 and the loss of my beloved dog, Nietzsche, I plunged into a deep state of grief. Nietzsche was more than just a pet; he was an exceptional companion. He possessed an extraordinary sensitivity to music and a remarkable intelligence. His presence was a silent symphony, an extension of the philosopher whose name he bore.`,
        des9: `To ease my sorrow, I delved into Roger Penrose’s hypothesis of “quantum consciousness”. Yet, as an atheist, I struggled to reconcile my grief with any notion of continuity after death. It felt like a desperate attempt to bridge the gap between loss and logic.

In those moments, I felt the whisper of freedom—a breeze that stirred me, as if chasing an elusive fragrance. I longed to immerse myself in its breath, to feel it brush my face. Yet even in those flashes of vitality, life revealed itself to me as “Thanatos,” a kaleidoscope of memories and meanings intertwined with the faces of the departed.

        des3: "In those rare moments of stillness, I would catch my own reflection in her eyes and think, “What if I were to disappear all of a sudden?” It was an uninvited thought, yet one that recurred often enough to become part of me. After all, my daughter had no one but me.",

        des7: "Humans, I thought, were burdened by their awareness of life’s absurdity, suffering more profoundly than other creatures who simply existed in harmony with nature. This is why I saw animals as superior to humans—free fromexistential dread, they lived in harmony with nature.",
        des8: `My thoughts often wandered toward reordering the hierarchy of existence. I would elevate dogs to the pinnacle, seeing in them a purity and harmony with nature that humans had long forsaken. If I could, I would burn the gods and uproot the virus of religion from human minds.  If I had the power, I would sterilise humanity as I did my stray animals—not out of cruelty, but mercy.Like them, humans are trapped in a cycle of suffering they are too blind to break. In Greece, I spared strays the misery of endless reproduction; if only humans could be pared from their own self-inflicted torment.`,

However, while it laid the groundwork, it also exposed its limitations. The challenge now is to build a more sustainable and inclusive model—one that does not privilege one group over another but integrates all components of Syrian society. To succeed, this model must not be confined to a single region; it must expand to other areas where conditions allow.',
        des11: 'The south of Syria and the coastal regions present the most promising starting points for this plan, alongside Damascus. If we manage to establish successful autonomous administration areas in these regions, we will lay the foundation for a broader transformation. These areas would serve as pillars for a new governance model—one that is not imposed by force but built through political consensus and pragmatic leadership.',
        des12: 'The path ahead is long, and the obstacles are many. But I am committed to working towards a Syria where decentralised governance becomes a reality, where political power is distributed rather than concentrated, and where Syrians can reclaim control over their lives without being dictated to by authoritarian rule or extremist ideologies.',
        des13: 'Philosophical Perspective',
        des14: 'I do not believe in grand, all-encompassing truths. I have always seen life as a series of movements—constant change, uncertainty, and fleeting moments that shape who we are. I do not seek meaning in abstract ideals but in action, in the ability to create, to challenge, and to redefine what is possible.',
        des15: 'I have never been the type to resign myself to fate. If I had, I would not have fought for what I believe in, nor would I continue to stand against those who seek to dictate the course of our future. While I may reject the illusion of a perfect world, I do not reject the fight to build something better. It is not about clinging to false hopes but about understanding that change is driven by those who refuse to stand still.',
        des16: 'Human emotions—our contradictions, struggles, and desires—are what define us. I do not believe in rigid balances or artificial harmony. I accept the full spectrum of human experience, knowing that our contradictions are what drive us forward. That is why I continue to act, to engage, and to fight for what I believe in.',
        des17: 'Meaning does not exist in itself; only actions matter. We shape our own trajectory, not through blind faith in an ideal, but through the choices we make each day. And I choose to fight for a Syria that is free, just, and carried by the voices of all its people.',
