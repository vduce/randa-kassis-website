      "an article exploring america's perceived role as global guardian, the persistence of binary thinking, and the illusion of moral supremacy.",
    des0: "As the crescendo of Ride of the Valkyries echoed and ground forces began advancing into Ukraine\u2014amid Western condemnation and threats of economic and military sanctions aimed at isolating Russia\u2014the West hoisted the banner of \u201cpride and resistance.\u201d",
    des1: "Zelensky appealed to Europe and the United States for unequivocal support, believing\u2014or perhaps merely hoping\u2014that America, in particular, would come to his rescue.",
    des2: "The Ukrainian president is not alone in regarding the United States as the ultimate guardian and sleepless sentinel, watching over its \u201cflock\u201d with unwavering vigilance. In this worldview, democracy is under its guardianship, and justice is its responsibility. This perspective is not exclusive to him; many across the globe share this vision. Just as some assume America\u2019s superiority, others see it as the enemy of peoples and nations\u2014a hegemonic power orchestrating conspiracies to dismantle governments that oppose its interests.",
    des3: "There is no denying that America\u2019s \u201cfailed\u201d wars and \u201cuninspired\u201d strategies\u2014draped in the rhetoric of moral intervention and bent on exporting a simplistic democratic model without regard for the complexities of culture\u2014have entrenched binary thinking. This dualism, the backbone of many cultures, offers a shallow and convenient answer for those unwilling to confront the layered nature of human societies. Thus, America becomes either an ally or an enemy\u2014nothing in between.",
    des4: "Hollywood\u2019s industrial-scale film production has only deepened this image, recasting the United States as a mythic hero in the imagination of some\u2014particularly those desperate to escape harsh realities. And so, reality blurs with longing, giving rise to the romanticism of the powerless.",
    des5: "This idea of American supremacy is not confined to those chasing the illusion of the \u201cAmerican dream\u201d; it extends equally to those who see the United States as a malevolent force, intent on crushing the aspirations of nations. Both sides, in their own way, reinforce the notion of a unipolar world, ignoring the emergence of other political, economic, and military powers\u2014and denying the reality of a multipolar global order.",
    des6: "The individual has long since surrendered to the notion of guardianship. In many societies, from birth, one falls under the authority of one\u2019s parents, only to be subsumed later by society, and then by the state. It is no surprise, then, that one ends up chasing the mirage of a modern-day \u201chero\u201d\u2014a figure shaped by fantasies and longings\u2014only to fall prey to propaganda.",
    des7: "This propaganda is by no means exclusive to the United States, but I highlight it here because of its vast cinematic machinery, which has fuelled its rise and prolonged its tiresome narrative\u2014one that no longer captures the imagination of any but the na\u00efve.",
    des8: "Many individuals and groups continue to suffer from binary thinking\u2014a legacy inherited from Plato, who equated justice with the health of the soul, and injustice with its illness. He laid the foundations of this dualistic framework, dividing the world into pairs: good and evil, justice and injustice, war and famine, health and disease, chaos and order, and so on.",
    des9: "Later philosophical traditions moved towards more pluralistic understandings, recognising the complex and multi-faceted nature of human psychology. Yet, even today, many cultures still rely heavily on binaries. Within them, the individual often retreats to a \u201cparadise\u201d of romantic elements\u2014constructs of imagined perfection.",
    des10:
      "For many, this paradise represents a sustained emotional or physical state, free of pain or injustice\u2014a realm of perpetual fairness, happiness, and tranquillity. And although some societies have managed to break free from the oppressive triad of power, granting broader rights to individuals and ensuring a greater degree of equality before the law, binary thinking still dominates. It prevails even among those engaged in public affairs.",
    des11:
      "It is clear that the implementation of justice in its \u201cfantastical\u201d sense remains, to this day, an impossibility\u2014incapable of aligning with the intricate nature of human behaviour, or of adapting to the multiplicity of cultures, political dynamics, military conflicts, or personal struggles. Binary thinking, then, is nothing more than a form of na\u00efve romanticism\u2014a delusion that many still insist on maintaining.",
    des12:
      "A brief glance at human history reveals a landscape riddled with conflict and primitive behaviours\u2014those which surface in times of war, famine, or existential threat.",
    des13:
      "From this, we can conclude that romantic idealism is an artificial construct\u2014alien to our nature. Humans do not inhabit a planet filled with cartoonish characters. Life is not a tidy dichotomy of good and evil, justice and injustice, peace and war, right and wrong. Rather, it is a complex entanglement of all these elements\u2014alongside countless others\u2014working together, however chaotically, in service of continuity.",

I know you devoted yourself to others, but I am certain that our distance caused you sadnessâeven if you never admitted it, even if you refused to acknowledge it. And I know, too, that we all disappointed you. You had every right to feel that way. For had my own daughter done to me what I did to you, I would have felt the same.",

I stare into the void, drowning in memories of all those I have lovedâyou among them. And I admit that I was harsh with youâor perhaps harshness has simply become a part of me. I search for you, for all those I have loved and lost, within the corridors of my mind, which still clings to your memory and theirs. No doubt you are present now with greater intensity because your departure is the most recent, while my memory pushes away those who left long ago. I wonder in silence: Can you hear me, wherever you are? But reason whispers back: There is no one there to listen.",

I will carry your memory like an ember in my heartâpainful, yet the only thing that keeps me close to you. No other world will reunite us, but you will remain alive within me, an eternal presence that will stay with me for the rest of my days.`,
    des9: `My only solace is knowing that you are free from pain. And so, I write not to seek redemption, nor to be absolved of what I cannot change, but simply because silence is unbearable.`,

The Russia-hosted Syrian National Dialogue Congress in Sochi may pave the way to the resolution of the Syrian crisis, Randa Kassis, the leader of the "Astana platform" of the Syrian opposition, has told Sputnik, highlighting the necessity of the creation of the constitutional commission during the ongoing summit to facilitate the peace process.`,
    des1: `Those who have come to the Syrian National Dialogue Congress in the Russian resort city of Sochi are motivated by patriotism and responsibility for the future of their country, Randa Kassis, the leader of the "Astana platform" of the Syrian opposition, told Sputnik Arabic, slamming those who snubbed the summit.`,
    des2: `"Anyone who refused to participate in the Sochi congress is irresponsible," the politician highlighted.`,
    des3: `According to Kassis, all the members of her delegation understand that the Syrian crisis could not be resolved under the aegis of the United States. The Syrians have to kick-start the process themselves, here, in Sochi, she stressed.`,
    des4: `"We must continue to work despite numerous difficulties faced by the Syrian opposition," the politician said. "We must do everything to ensure the success of the Sochi talks."`,
    des5: `Kassis underscored that President Vladimir Putin's initiative to hold the Syrian National Dialogue Congress in Sochi is an important step, which, unfortunately, was not accepted by some political figures.`,
    des6: `"If Vladimir Putin initiated something, it means not just the intention to do something, but the implementation of the objectives," she pointed out. "Therefore, I pin my hopes on the event and this is why we arrived in Sochi."`,
    des7: `The politician emphasised that she had made efforts to gather as many representatives of the Syrian opposition as possible to form a working group. "We need to start finding the way out of the crisis immediately. I believe that it is impossible without the creation of a new constitution," she noted.`,
    des8: `Speaking to Sputnik, Kassis shed light on the Astana platform's plans and program. The politician emphasised the necessity to create a "constitutional commission" within the framework of the negotiations.`,
    des9: `"We need to start working on a new Syrian constitution," she said. "We have prepared our own draft constitution, on which we have spent a year working on."`,
    des10: `According to the politician one of the most important issues concerning the future Syrian constitution is the maintenance of a secular state: "To clarify this issue I offered the following [definition]: the secularism is defined by the state's neutrality to religious or non-religious beliefs of a Syrian citizen," she said, "Beliefs could be not only religious, it could be views or a position and a person should have freedom [to express them]."`,
    des11: `The present Syrian constitution offers four options to define a Syrian citizen's religious beliefs: Sunni Muslim, Druze, Orthodox or Catholic Christian. Kassis explained that for ordinary Syrians the matters of marriages and inheritance are closely connected with their religious beliefs and existing state laws.`,
    des12: `She noted that "in order to overcome the potential difficulties" she proposes "to introduce the fifth category â "a Syrian citizen" â without any religious references."`,
    des13: `"It is necessary to give the Syrians the freedom of choice. A person may prefer to live in an exclusively secular legal field," Kassis suggested.`,
    des14: `On January 30 the Syrian national dialogue congress officially opened in Sochi. The summit has brought together various opposition and pro-governmental forces, as well as representatives of the country's numerous ethnic and religious groups in order to facilitate the peace process with the focus on the Syrian constitution and elections.`,
    des15: `The UN Security Council permanent members as well as Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Lebanon and Saudi Arabia were also invited to participate in the event as observers. However, a number of states including the US and France, refused to attend, as did the Syrian Negotiation Commission (SNC) opposition group.`,

Or was it enough that they believed I would? I will never know the answer. What I do know is that in that moment, the balance of power changed. I saw fear flicker in their eyes, and with it, I understood something fundamental: power is an illusion, sustained only by submission. I had refused to submit.",
    des8: `That moment did not just shape how others saw me; it shaped how I saw myself. It changed my place in that school. The girls, who had once been passive observers, now looked to me for protection. The boys, who had sought to put me in my place, now knew I would not be tamed. But beyond that, something deeper had taken root in me. I understood, in a visceral way, that authorityâwhether in the form of a schoolyard bully or a greater systemâwas only as strong as our willingness to accept it. That lesson stayed with me. Over time, I distanced myself from all girls who had once followed the script written for them. I questioned religion, society, moralityâevery structure that sought to define my existence. My father, an agnostic, had instilled in me the value of independent thought, and I took that lesson to its extreme. I rejected all imposed beliefs, seeing them as viruses infecting human minds. My disdain for authority extended beyond the personal to the political, and my involvement in Syria's revolution was not just a political stanceâit was an extension of who I had become.`,
    des9: `Algeria was my second birth. It was there that I first saw myself clearly, as though I had been shedding layers all along, waiting for the moment when my true nature would finally emerge. Perhaps my first physical fight with the boys at school had been the catalyst for this change. In that moment, I understoodâas did everyone elseâthat the quiet Syrian Randa no longer existed. Fear had left her, and no authority, no God, could intimidate her again`,
    des10: `Since childhood, I had wrestled with life's most perplexing questions: What is life? Why do we cling to it so fiercely? Is it driven by our egocentrism, or merely the cowardice to sever what procreation has set in motion?`,

    des1: "When I returned to Syria at 12, I rebelled against everyoneâauthority, the police, and especially the political system. I refused to be enrolled in the Shabiba (Ba'ath Youth), rejecting the indoctrination and slogans forced upon students. I never accepted to be just a number in this country, a cog in the system that dictated how we should think, act, and exist.",
    des2: "Since the age of fourteen, I had engaged my friends in Damascus in debates over the existence of God. Back then, no one dared question religion or the notion of a creator. They labelled me a heretic, believing that me disregard for social and political order was a direct result of my rejection of both God and authority.",

    des3: "At fifteen, my rebellion deepened. I made acquaintances with French employees at the French Cultural Center, where I found an intellectual and cultural connection that was absent among my own friends. At the same time, I traveled across Syria with friends my age, engaging in endless debates about God, religions, and the taboos that society tried to impose on us. Photo 10 Photo 11 Photo 12 Photo 13",
    des4: "Since adolescence, life was something to be consumedâevery last drop, whether bitter or sweet. After my baccalaureate, I went to Germany to study, but I quickly realised that its structured, rigid, and highly organised society did not suit me. It felt too constrained, too predictable, too confining.",
    des5: `There, I met refugees who had fled warâLebanese, Palestiniansâand for the first time, I truly connected with the full scope of Palestinian suffering, beyond the fragments I had heard from my mother, who worked at UNRWA in Damascus, or the stories of resistance I had encountered at school. Photo 14 Photo 15 Photo 16 Photo 17`,
    des6: `I went to Paris, the city I had first fallen in love with at 10 years old, a place that had left an imprint on my mind. Paris had always felt like homeâits intellectual vibrancy, its artistic defiance, its embrace of free thought resonated with the spirit of rebellion I carried within me.`,

I was passionate about causes, about ideas, about possibilities, but I also saw the futility in human existence. I oscillated between engagement and nihilism, between building something new and accepting that nothing truly lasts. Death was not something I feared; rather, I saw it as an inevitable release, perhaps even a form of salvation. And maybe that's why I sought movement, why stability never suited meâI needed to chase moments of fascination before they lost their meaning. Photo 18 Photo 19 Photo 20`,

Her life was a tragedy in itselfâa mother who had survived the Shoah, a father who refused to acknowledge her, and the wreckage of two failed love stories. Over time, life became increasingly unbearable for her, and depression consumed her until, one day, she chose to surrender herself to death.",

    des5: "At the beginning of 1994, I started painting. My brother, Jeanâone of the greatest contemporary painters in my eyesâwas my first inspiration. I was drawn to his creative style, captivated by the raw intensity of his work.",
    des6: "For me, painting was never just a craft; it was an act of defianceâa rebellion against imposed narratives and the rigid expectations of what a woman should be. My work was raw, unfiltered, unapologetic. From the very beginning, my art was a form of resistance, a means to challenge the world as I saw it, to reject the suffocating conventions that sought to dictate how a woman, a body, or an artist should be perceived.",
    des7: `The female form has always been central to my work, but not in the way it's been commodified for centuries. I refused to depicted it as a passive object of beauty or desire. To me, the body is a battlefieldâa paradox, both a prison and a tool of liberation. My brushstrokes were never meant to comfort; they were meant to provoke, to unearth something unsettling, something that forces the viewer to confront their own gaze, their own biases.`,
    des8: `I never cared for perfect symmetry or predictable aesthetics. I paint to merge chaos with structure, to blend dream and reality until the line between them collapses. My canvases don't tell linear storiesâthey vibrate, they pulse with contradictions. Critics have said my work feels like musicâthat it carries its own rhythm. I like that idea. Because art, for me, has always been about breaking silence, shattering complacency.`,
    des9: `I've exhibited my work in different places, seen people stare, question, sometimes even recoil. And I embrace that. Art should be unsettling. It should gnaw at something inside you, push you to see beyond the surface.Photo 25 Photo 26 Photo 27 Photo 28 Photo 29`,

I would elevate dogs to the pinnacle, seeing in them a purity and harmony with nature that humans had long forsaken.

Establishing autonomous administrative areas is not a theoretical idealâit is a necessity. It offers the only viable path to breaking the cycle of conflict and preventing the monopolisation of governance by any single faction, sect, or ideology.",
    des9: "A decade ago, the northeast of Syria pioneered an autonomous administration model, proving that decentralisation is achievable. Yet it also exposed its shortcomings. The challenge now is to construct a more inclusive and sustainable modelâone that does not privilege any single group but integrates all elements of Syrian society. For such a model to succeed, it must not remain confined to one region; it must extend to others where the conditions allow.",
    des10: "Southern Syria and the coastal regions are the most promising starting points for this plan, alongside Damascus. Should we succeed in establishing effective autonomous administrations in these regions, they could become the cornerstones of a broader transformation. These areas would form the pillars of a new governance modelâone built not through coercion but through political consensus and pragmatic leadership.",
    des11:
      "The road ahead is long, and the challenges are many. Yet I remain committed to building a Syria where political power is distributed, not concentratedâwhere Syrians can reclaim their agency, free from authoritarianism and extremism.",

      "I do not believe in grand, all-encompassing truths. I have always seen life as a series of movementsâconstant change, uncertainty, and fleeting moments that shape who we are. I do not seek meaning in abstract ideals, but in actionâin the ability to create, to challenge, and to redefine what is possible.",

      "I have never been the type to resign myself to fate. If I had, I would not have fought for what I believe in, nor would I continue to stand against those who seek to dictate the course of our future. While I may reject the illusion of a perfect world, I do not reject the fight to build something better. It is not about clinging to false hopes but about understanding that change is driven by those who refuse to stand still.",

      "I have never been one to resign myself to fate. Had I done so, I would not have fought for what I believe in, nor would I continue to stand against those who seek to determine our destiny for us. Though I reject the illusion of a perfect world, I do not reject the struggle to build a better one. It is not about clinging to false hopes, but about understanding that change is driven by those who refuse to remain passive.",

    //   "Human emotionsâour contradictions, struggles, and desiresâare what define us. I do not believe in rigid balances or artificial harmony. I embrace the full spectrum of human experience, knowing that it is through our contradictions that we move forward. This is why I continue to act, to engage, and to fight for what I believe in.",
