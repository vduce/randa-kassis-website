      "slug": "the-american-mirage-guardian-illusion-dualism",
      "screens": "blog1.png",
      "storyTitle": "an article exploring america's perceived role as global guardian, the persistence of binary thinking, and the illusion of moral supremacy.",
      "des0": "As the crescendo of Ride of the Valkyries echoed and ground forces began advancing into Ukraine—amid Western condemnation and threats of economic and military sanctions aimed at isolating Russia—the West hoisted the banner of \"pride and resistance.\"",
      "des1": "Zelensky appealed to Europe and the United States for unequivocal support, believing—or perhaps merely hoping—that America, in particular, would come to his rescue.",
      "des2": "The Ukrainian president is not alone in regarding the United States as the ultimate guardian and sleepless sentinel, watching over its \"flock\" with unwavering vigilance. In this worldview, democracy is under its guardianship, and justice is its responsibility. This perspective is not exclusive to him; many across the globe share this vision. Just as some assume America's superiority, others see it as the enemy of peoples and nations—a hegemonic power orchestrating conspiracies to dismantle governments that oppose its interests.",
      "des3": "There is no denying that America's \"failed\" wars and \"uninspired\" strategies—draped in the rhetoric of moral intervention and bent on exporting a simplistic democratic model without regard for the complexities of culture—have entrenched binary thinking. This dualism, the backbone of many cultures, offers a shallow and convenient answer for those unwilling to confront the layered nature of human societies. Thus, America becomes either an ally or an enemy—nothing in between.",
      "des4": "Hollywood's industrial-scale film production has only deepened this image, recasting the United States as a mythic hero in the imagination of some—particularly those desperate to escape harsh realities. And so, reality blurs with longing, giving rise to the romanticism of the powerless.",
      "des5": "This idea of American supremacy is not confined to those chasing the illusion of the \"American dream\"; it extends equally to those who see the United States as a malevolent force, intent on crushing the aspirations of nations. Both sides, in their own way, reinforce the notion of a unipolar world, ignoring the emergence of other political, economic, and military powers—and denying the reality of a multipolar global order.",
      "des6": "The individual has long since surrendered to the notion of guardianship. In many societies, from birth, one falls under the authority of one's parents, only to be subsumed later by society, and then by the state. It is no surprise, then, that one ends up chasing the mirage of a modern-day \"hero\"—a figure shaped by fantasies and longings—only to fall prey to propaganda.",
      "des7": "This propaganda is by no means exclusive to the United States, but I highlight it here because of its vast cinematic machinery, which has fuelled its rise and prolonged its tiresome narrative—one that no longer captures the imagination of any but the naïve.",
      "des8": "Many individuals and groups continue to suffer from binary thinking—a legacy inherited from Plato, who equated justice with the health of the soul, and injustice with its illness. He laid the foundations of this dualistic framework, dividing the world into pairs: good and evil, justice and injustice, war and famine, health and disease, chaos and order, and so on.",
      "des9": "Later philosophical traditions moved towards more pluralistic understandings, recognising the complex and multi-faceted nature of human psychology. Yet, even today, many cultures still rely heavily on binaries. Within them, the individual often retreats to a \"paradise\" of romantic elements—constructs of imagined perfection.",
      "des10": "For many, this paradise represents a sustained emotional or physical state, free of pain or injustice—a realm of perpetual fairness, happiness, and tranquillity. And although some societies have managed to break free from the oppressive triad of power, granting broader rights to individuals and ensuring a greater degree of equality before the law, binary thinking still dominates. It prevails even among those engaged in public affairs.",
      "des11": "It is clear that the implementation of justice in its \"fantastical\" sense remains, to this day, an impossibility—incapable of aligning with the intricate nature of human behaviour, or of adapting to the multiplicity of cultures, political dynamics, military conflicts, or personal struggles. Binary thinking, then, is nothing more than a form of naïve romanticism—a delusion that many still insist on maintaining.",
      "des12": "A brief glance at human history reveals a landscape riddled with conflict and primitive behaviours—those which surface in times of war, famine, or existential threat.",
      "des13": "From this, we can conclude that romantic idealism is an artificial construct—alien to our nature. Humans do not inhabit a planet filled with cartoonish characters. Life is not a tidy dichotomy of good and evil, justice and injustice, peace and war, right and wrong. Rather, it is a complex entanglement of all these elements—alongside countless others—working together, however chaotically, in service of continuity.",

      "des3": "I have no right to weep for you, for I was never by your side. I have no right to speak of pain, for I was always far from you. <br><br>I cannot even ask for your forgiveness, for you have departed this life, and there is no life for you beyond it. How, then, can I console myself, when I have spent years burdened by the bitterness of self-reproach since my father's passing? I left just days before his death and never stayed. Was I fleeing from grief, from finality? Or was I simply placing myself above all else? I do not know…",
      "des4": "But I do know that I have done it again—with you. I returned to Syria a month before your death, yet I left you once more. Was it something in my blood, an instinct to escape? Or do I carry a detachment that even I do not fully understand? Perhaps… I will find no answer until my own final moments—only then will I know what you both felt when your children were absent.",
      "des5": "And I do not know why I write these words. Am I confessing my failures, declaring to the world that I was a daughter who never truly thought of you? Or am I simply trying to release the weight that chokes me? Perhaps I am just someone incapable of keeping emotions locked within, needing to declare to all: I am who I am.",
      "des6": "Nothing has stripped me of my strength as your absence has. Nothing has left me so exposed to my sorrow as your passing has. I know you devoted yourself to others, but I am certain that our distance caused you sadness—even if you never admitted it, even if you refused to acknowledge it. And I know, too, that we all disappointed you. You had every right to feel that way. For had my own daughter done to me what I did to you, I would have felt the same.",
      "des7": "At night, when I struggle to sleep despite the breathing exercises and techniques that no longer work, my mind drifts far away. I stare into the void, drowning in memories of all those I have loved—you among them. And I admit that I was harsh with you—or perhaps harshness has simply become a part of me. I search for you, for all those I have loved and lost, within the corridors of my mind, which still clings to your memory and theirs. No doubt you are present now with greater intensity because your departure is the most recent, while my memory pushes away those who left long ago. I wonder in silence: Can you hear me, wherever you are? But reason whispers back: There is no one there to listen.",
      "des8": "All I have left of you are memories and the image of your face in my mind, just like those who passed before you. I will carry your memory like an ember in my heart—painful, yet the only thing that keeps me close to you. No other world will reunite us, but you will remain alive within me, an eternal presence that will stay with me for the rest of my days.",
      "des9": "My only solace is knowing that you are free from pain. And so, I write not to seek redemption, nor to be absolved of what I cannot change, but simply because silence is unbearable.",

      "storyTitle": "<strong>I was not born a rebel, but rebellion found me early.</strong>",
      "des1": "As a child, I was inquisitive—curious about the world, about my body, about the invisible rules that dictated how I should exist within it. I remember being five or six years old, exploring myself with innocent curiosity, only to discover something I had been conditioned to believe was impure. My instinct was to cleanse, to rid myself of what I thought was dirt. But that act, simple and instinctive, was also my first conscious rejection of an imposed taboo.",
      "des2": "Later, as an adolescent, I repeated the act—not out of naivety, but with full intention. I had no desire for my hymen to be lost through sexual intercourse, for it to be a symbol of virtue or a transaction. I despised its very concept.",
      "des3": "Even before I understood rebellion in an intellectual sense, I had already lived it. Algeria shaped me in ways I could never have anticipated. There, that I grasped the nature of power—how it operates, how it can be resisted. I had moved from a relatively sheltered world into an environment where survival meant more than just existing; it required assertion, defiance, a willingness to stand one's ground. I was not born a fighter, but Algeria made me one. Photo 4 Photo 5 Photo 6",
      "des4": "<strong>The First Battle: Defying Power</strong>",
      "des5": "My first physical confrontation was a defining moment. It happened in the schoolyard, a place that, for many children, is merely a setting for games and lessons, but for me, it became an early battlefield. A group of boys, emboldened by their own sense of entitlement, sought to intimidate me. I refused to shrink. When one of them made his move, I retaliated. I knocked him to the ground, but that act of defiance came at a price. The boys turned on me, pelting me with stones.",
      "des6": "The pain was real, but it wasn't what left a mark on me. What I remember most vividly isn't the pain—it's the realisation that fear is a weapon. And I could choose not to carry it. I stood there, battered but unbroken, and something shifted within me. I knew that mere defence was not enough. I had to go on the offensive.",
      "des7": "I charged toward one of the boys, grabbed a stone larger than the ones they had thrown, and raised it high. For a brief second, I hesitated. Did I truly intend to strike? Or was it enough that they believed I would? I will never know the answer. What I do know is that in that moment, the balance of power changed. I saw fear flicker in their eyes, and with it, I understood something fundamental: power is an illusion, sustained only by submission. I had refused to submit.",
      "des8": "That moment did not just shape how others saw me; it shaped how I saw myself. It changed my place in that school. The girls, who had once been passive observers, now looked to me for protection. The boys, who had sought to put me in my place, now knew I would not be tamed. But beyond that, something deeper had taken root in me. I understood, in a visceral way, that authority—whether in the form of a schoolyard bully or a greater system—was only as strong as our willingness to accept it. That lesson stayed with me. Over time, I distanced myself from all girls who had once followed the script written for them. I questioned religion, society, morality—every structure that sought to define my existence. My father, an agnostic, had instilled in me the value of independent thought, and I took that lesson to its extreme. I rejected all imposed beliefs, seeing them as viruses infecting human minds. My disdain for authority extended beyond the personal to the political, and my involvement in Syria's revolution was not just a political stance—it was an extension of who I had become.",
      "des9": "Algeria was my second birth. It was there that I first saw myself clearly, as though I had been shedding layers all along, waiting for the moment when my true nature would finally emerge. Perhaps my first physical fight with the boys at school had been the catalyst for this change. In that moment, I understood—as did everyone else—that the quiet Syrian Randa no longer existed. Fear had left her, and no authority, no God, could intimidate her again",
      "des10": "Since childhood, I had wrestled with life's most perplexing questions: What is life? Why do we cling to it so fiercely? Is it driven by our egocentrism, or merely the cowardice to sever what procreation has set in motion?",

      "des1": "After years of living abroad, I found myself standing at the threshold of my homeland once more. The air was different—thicker, heavier with memories and unspoken truths. The streets I had once known so well now felt both familiar and foreign, like a dream half-remembered upon waking.",
      "des2": "The city had changed, but so had I. The young girl who had left was now a woman who had seen the world, who had fought her battles, who had learned that sometimes the greatest revolutions begin within oneself.",

      "des6": "I walked these streets not as a tourist, not as a stranger, but as someone who belonged to this place even as it had changed beyond recognition. The weight of memory was both a burden and a gift, a reminder of all that had been lost and all that remained to be fought for.",
      "des7": "The people I met—old friends, new acquaintances, strangers who became confidants—each had their own story of survival, of resistance, of hope. Their resilience was a testament to the human spirit's capacity to endure, to adapt, to dream of a better tomorrow even in the darkest of times.",
      "des8": "In their eyes, I saw reflections of my own journey—the pain of separation, the joy of reunion, the determination to build something new from the ruins of the past. We were all pieces of a larger puzzle, each with our own role to play in the story of our homeland.",

      "des6": "Each act of defiance, no matter how small, was a step toward freedom. Each question asked, each assumption challenged, was a brick removed from the wall of tradition that sought to confine me.",
      "des7": "The process was not without cost. There were moments of loneliness, of doubt, of wondering if the price of freedom was too high. But with each challenge overcome, I grew stronger, more certain of my path, more determined to live life on my own terms.",
