My first exhibition took place in Damascus from 15 to 25 March 1995. I chose my birthplace as the starting point of my artistic journey—not out of a sense of identity, but to engage with its culture and society.

Later that year, in June 1995, I travelled to London to exhibit my paintings, drawn by the city’s longstanding tradition of supporting the arts, dating back to the patronage of the 17th century. London has always inspired artists with its cosmopolitan atmosphere and rich artistic heritage.

Without pause, I departed London and travelled to Amman, where I held an exhibition at the Royal Cultural Centre from 29 July to 3 August 1995. The opening was held under the patronage of Jordan’s then-Minister of Culture, Samir Habashneh.

While in Amman, I was invited to showcase my work at the Fuheis Festival throughout August. It was a delightful experience to present my art in such a vibrant cultural setting.

That year, I was brimming with energy and had no desire to pause after all I had painted the previous year. In September 1995, I exhibited in Dubai. The opening was held under the patronage of Sheikh Hasher Al Maktoum, Director of Dubai’s Department of Information.

My final exhibition of 1995 took place in Abu Dhabi from 24 to 29 December, under the patronage of Sheikh Said bin Tahnoun Al Nahyan, a member of the Executive Council. The opening was attended by several ambassadors, including the Syrian ambassador.

One month later, encouraged by the success in Abu Dhabi, I organised another exhibition in Al Ain in January 1996.

In April 1996, I embarked on a different kind of experience. Alongside a director and his team, we began filming a video clip about art, aiming to create a piece that explored the idea of art’s immortality. While all living beings exist only briefly, art endures—like eternity itself. Fittingly, the title of the video clip was Eternity.

I was incredibly active at the time, as if driven by an instinctive feeling that I would soon be distanced from my paintings and artistic 'lifestyle'. I organised another exhibition in
Damascus from 3 to 13 October, under the patronage of the Syrian Minister of Information, Mohamad Salman.

Looking back, that period feels like a fleeting blaze—intense, unrelenting, and full of purpose. I was carried by a wave I neither questioned nor tried to tame, as if I already sensed that a rupture was inevitable. By the end of 1996, I was pregnant and soon entirely absorbed by the demands and beauty of motherhood. My brushes fell silent—not by choice, but because life had taken a different course.
It wasn’t until mid-1998 that I attempted to return, organising an exhibition in Juan-les-Pins, France. Although I wasn’t present at the vernissage, it marked a quiet attempt to reconnect with the world I had temporarily left behind. The urgency of that earlier time never returned in quite the same way, but its spirit still lingers—a testament to a time when art was not merely a vocation, but a state of being.

That reconnection continued on 2 February 1999, when I returned to London to exhibit at the Kufa Gallery until 8 February. Though the fervour of the earlier period never fully returned, its essence remained within me.

Between 26 May and 17 June 2000, my brother Jean and I curated an exhibition at Espace Richelieu, located in the prestigious Carré d’Or district of Paris. The event welcomed several distinguished artists, including Jane Manson.

The following year, from 17 to 27 February 2001, Jean and I organised another exhibition in Paris, this time at Artimus Gallery.

My path in the world of painting came to a close, and I began searching for a new way to express myself—one that could free me from the monotony of life.
