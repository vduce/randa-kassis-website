<h4>The Dysfunction of Perception in the Presence of the Absolute</h4>

I begin this article with a familiar maxim:

“One of the earliest teachings imparted to a human being is never to follow any principle blindly or in herd-like fashion, nor to defend any idea or belief without clear personal conviction.”

To this, I would add: one must recognise the limits of one’s knowledge—however expansive it may seem—resist the temptation of an all-knowing ego, and abandon the stubbornness that comes from clinging to perspectives shaped solely by individual experience or immediate surroundings. Only then can we broaden our understanding, soar into vast intellectual spaces, and consciously savour the boundless freedom of creative thought.

In response to a series of messages accusing me of “Freudianism”, I dedicate this article to acknowledging the contributions of several scholars in psychology, neuroscience, and anthropology—fields I have drawn upon extensively in my work.

While it is true that many of Freud’s ideas have become foundational to various schools of psychology, those very schools have also challenged several of his assumptions, often accusing him of becoming entangled in overly elaborate theories. The concept of libido, for instance, is no longer confined to Freud’s framework; it has become a key element in numerous psychological models. A closer look at contemporary neurological research reveals both convergence with and divergence from Freudian thought.

I intend to explore these intersections and contradictions in a more expansive future essay. For now, the limited space of this piece compels me to focus on a more specific concern: the act of perceiving the Other—not through reflexive rejection or ego-centric interpretation, but through an openness that transcends inherited certainties.

What puzzled me most about the aforementioned messages was not simply their rejection of the psychological and anthropological foundations underpinning my arguments, but their reduction of these perspectives to a simplistic Freudian label. This, despite my meticulous citation of relevant scholars for each concept I referenced—precisely to avoid such misreadings and to shield the discussion from ideological dismissal.

This prompted a moment of self-questioning. Was the failure to communicate mine? But the arrival of other, more perceptive responses—messages marked by intellectual depth and a willingness to transcend the confines of the ego—allowed me to shift my focus from self-doubt to the deeper question of where the misunderstanding truly lies. I rarely encounter such resistance when engaging with individuals from non-Arab cultures.

Let us consider, then, the mechanisms of perception. These begin with an ego structured by mental images embedded in the brain, which are in turn processed through sensation, shaped by the external environment, collective context, and imagination. From this interplay emerges the individual self.

In Arab societies, the perceptual framework is often shaped by fixed religious tenets absorbed from early childhood. These ingrained structures prevent the individual from connecting with their instincts or plumbing the depths of their own psyche. They enclose the person within a framework of false values that conflict with their psychological makeup.

And yet, paradoxically, such structures awaken in the individual a need for distinction—often satisfied through religious pride and identification with sacred symbols. This phenomenon is not limited to religion; it extends to ideologies, nationalisms, and ethnic identities. The result is a readiness to impose fixed labels on language and expression.

This tendency towards generalisation induces a partial paralysis in the face of new meanings and concepts. The individual becomes incapable of navigating alternative modes of thought, unable to venture beyond the inherited values lodged in their mental landscape. What often appears as a flat rejection of unfamiliar ideas is, in truth, a symptom of a cognitive foundation that excludes critical inquiry and cultivates rigid attachment to inherited beliefs. The individual thus becomes tethered to their opinions, resistant to novelty, and subordinated to collective norms and divine authority.

The neurologist Lionel Naccache offers a compelling account of how we recognise others—not as a straightforward reception of information, but as a complex internal process. He argues that recognition involves an active preparatory stage that includes imagination and individual interpretation. In other words, the act of recognising another is mediated through a network of personal beliefs that constitute the ego.

Thus, the “programmed” individual—incapable of reconfiguring their inner framework—projects meaning onto language in accordance with their own conceptual schemes. This leads to overgeneralisation, dissolving nuance and obscuring any attempt to break free from the confines of familiar categories.

There is no denying that dismantling the belief systems upon which one has built an entire life is no easy task. Nor is it easy to dislodge an ego modelled on an omniscient, god-like figure. Such individuals instinctively reject any idea they have not previously encountered. When we examine the human psyche, we find it grounded, first, in biological structures, and second, in the cultural context in which it develops.

It would be difficult to explain the full process of perception here, particularly as I am relying on recent neurological findings and psychological hypotheses. For this reason, I have dedicated an extended section of my forthcoming book to exploring these themes in depth.

Returning to the matter of knowledge and the specific difficulties encountered among some Arabic-speaking readers: many insist on the accuracy of their interpretations, applying personal dictionaries to unfamiliar expressions without any effort to engage with the ideas presented.

In my current, provisional view—subject to revision—I believe the core of the problem lies in early childhood education. It is grounded in what are perceived as “absolute truths” handed down through religious teaching—truths presented as beyond questioning or doubt.

This is, I believe, the root of the intellectual crisis in Arab societies: rigid foundations that encourage individuals to cling to narrow understandings of knowledge, understandings shaped and surveilled by religious institutions, governmental powers, and even the self.

If we look at the process of perception—of becoming aware of ideas—through a neurological lens, we find that it depends on the individual’s capacity and continuous willingness to question all beliefs, foundations, and aspects of the self. It is a constant exercise in dismantling the illusion of truth, a readiness to embrace “non-truths” in the hope of extracting from them fragments of reality.
