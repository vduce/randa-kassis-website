<h4>Arab Revolutions and Political Islam</h4>

Amid the popular uprisings erupting across the Arab world in defiance of tyranny, concerns persist over the ascendancy of Islamist movements and their potential to appropriate these revolutionary currents—particularly given the religious and ideological leanings of the masses involved. In this context, it becomes increasingly plausible that political Islam will seek to exploit the unconscious energies fuelling these revolts, especially in societies that lack clear political vision or well-defined institutional frameworks.

It is for this reason that the need to expose these movements becomes ever more urgent. They pose a grave threat—not only to our societies specifically, but also to human thought in general. These movements are fundamentally anti-civilisational, undermining scientific achievement and intellectual freedom, despite their hollow claims of safeguarding knowledge, diversity, and individual liberty.

The attempt to unmask the true face of these radical Islamist movements should not be misconstrued as an attack on Islam itself. On the contrary, it stems from a desire to liberate Islam from its tribal origins, so that it might adapt to the evolving dynamics of history and modernity.

Perhaps we must also turn our attention to the Arab-Islamic psyche, which harbours within it a certain form of awareness—sometimes even a recognition—that the world has moved beyond it. Although this psyche is dispersed across diverse societies, and although the collective memory of each varies due to different social structures, these societies share common afflictions and comparable symptoms. This is largely due to the influence of two unifying factors: religion and language—beneath which the Arab world is broadly unified.

Before delving further, it is worth reflecting on the role of language in shaping collective consciousness and harmonising individual perception. Language wields a powerful influence in bringing people together; it carries with it layers of accumulated experience passed down through generations. The models we internalise are often drawn from visual memory or oral transmission, frequently charged with emotional resonance.

Since the invention of writing, human beings have recorded their thoughts—and in doing so, their behaviours—embedding them in the collective memory. These records manifest as customs, which arise from a process of communal filtration of individual experiences. What aligns with the external environment is retained; what does not is discarded. Over time, these filtered experiences become the foundations of communal ethics and codes of conduct, imposed upon individuals.

What Islam has attempted to do—or more precisely, what it has done over centuries (as with other religions)—is to implant mental representations that offer psychological comfort in the face of a painful, deprived reality. What sets Islam apart in our current era, however, is its insistence on excluding the other—a trait that contemporary iterations of other religions have largely abandoned. These religions were previously excluded from political structures, and were thus compelled to adopt a more spiritual character, one that better aligns with individual psychological needs. The goal, then, is to return religions—and the gods they invoke—to their original source: the human psyche.

This calls for a critical reassessment of the history curriculum in Arab schools with Islamic cultural orientations. While differences in emphasis exist between countries, these curricula are often deliberately structured to generate imagery of Islamic victories and to instil a sense of superiority over others. This attitude is encapsulated in a phrase repeated by many Muslims: “Thank God for the blessing of Islam”—a statement laden with chauvinism and implicit exclusion of the other.

Undoubtedly, the Muslim individual’s experience of marginalisation and their repeated frustrations—stemming from an inability to contribute creatively or civilisationally, as others do—has led to a kind of internalised, limited awareness, one that is constantly nourished by sacred history and unquestioned texts.

Let me reiterate: the problem does not lie with Islam per se, but with the structure of all religions, which tend to deprive the individual of even their most basic physical needs. Religions enclose individuals within a shell through which clerics extend their control over communities.

It must also be noted that most religions and belief systems engage in a process of erasing what preceded them—even as they borrow and absorb the ideas of those prior systems. They claim for themselves the mantle of salvation, enlightenment, or truth. This is made especially clear in Islam’s depiction of pre-Islamic Arabia as an age of ignorance (jahiliyyah), thereby dismissing all prior knowledge and heritage—even though Islam itself is a product of that very cultural and historical milieu.

Our pride in religious or cultural identity is often the result of a process of self-glorification. Individuals tend to affirm that which mirrors their own psychological and cultural structure, while rejecting what is unfamiliar or different. This is what we mean by perception. Expanding one’s awareness requires openness to difference. The rigidity with which individuals cling to their beliefs, cultures, or inherited knowledge is largely the product of conditioned indoctrination.

Returning to the subject of mental representations drawn from distorted histories—delivered to children through school curricula, reinforced in places of worship, or transmitted through the general culture of Islamised societies—recent neurological studies show that these representations become fixed in the long-term collective memory through repeated exposure. With time, they evolve into absolute truths that cannot be questioned or re-examined. They become pillars of behaviour, shaping the very foundations of social conduct.

These embedded mental constructs profoundly influence perception and shape behaviour within tightly defined parameters. We find that Islamic culture, in particular, has sought to strip Islamised societies of their pre-existing histories, positioning itself as the sole origin of knowledge and science, thus denying the wider human contribution that preceded it. In doing so, it seeks to impose a singular mode of thinking, making it easier to govern and control the masses.

There is, of course, much more that could be said and explored in this field. But the limits of this article do not permit a full treatment of all that deserves attention.
