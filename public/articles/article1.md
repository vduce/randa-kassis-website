<h4>The American Mirage: Between the Illusion of Guardianship and the Naivety of Dualism</h4>

As the crescendo of Ride of the Valkyries echoed and ground forces began advancing into Ukraine—amid Western condemnation and threats of economic and military sanctions aimed at isolating Russia—the West hoisted the banner of 'pride and resistance.'

Zelensky appealed to Europe and the United States for unequivocal support, believing—or perhaps merely hoping—that America, in particular, would come to his rescue.

The Ukrainian president is not alone in regarding the United States as the ultimate guardian and sleepless sentinel, watching over its 'flock' with unwavering vigilance. In this worldview, democracy is under its guardianship, and justice is its responsibility. This perspective is not exclusive to him; many across the globe share this vision. Just as some assume America’s superiority, others see it as the enemy of peoples and nations—a hegemonic power orchestrating conspiracies to dismantle governments that oppose its interests.

There is no denying that America’s 'failed' wars and 'uninspired strategies-draped in the rhetoric of moral intervention and bent on exporting a simplistic democratic model without regard for the complexities of culture—have entrenched binary thinking. This dualism, the backbone of many cultures, offers a shallow and convenient answer for those unwilling to confront the layered nature of human societies. Thus, America becomes either an ally or an enemy—nothing in between.

Hollywood’s industrial-scale film production has only deepened this image, recasting the United States as a mythic hero in the imagination of some—particularly those desperate to escape harsh realities. And so, reality blurs with longing, giving rise to the romanticism of the powerless.

This idea of American supremacy is not confined to those chasing the illusion of the 'American Dream'; it extends equally to those who see the United States as a malevolent force, intent on crushing the aspirations of nations. Both sides, in their own way, reinforce the notion of a unipolar world, ignoring the emergence of other political, economic, and military powers—and denying the reality of a multipolar global order.

The individual has long since surrendered to the notion of guardianship. In many societies, from birth, one falls under the authority of one’s parents, only to be subsumed later by society, and then by the state. It is no surprise, then, that one ends up chasing the mirage of a modern-day 'hero'—a figure shaped by fantasies and longings—only to fall prey to propaganda.

This propaganda is by no means exclusive to the United States, but I highlight it here because of its vast cinematic machinery, which has fuelled its rise and prolonged its tiresome narrative—one that no longer captures the imagination of any but the naïve.

Many individuals and groups continue to suffer from binary thinking—a legacy inherited from Plato, who equated justice with the health of the soul, and injustice with its illness. He laid the foundations of this dualistic framework, dividing the world into pairs: good and evil, justice and injustice, war and famine, health and disease, chaos and order, and so on.

Later philosophical traditions moved towards more pluralistic understandings, recognising the complex and multi-faceted nature of human psychology. Yet, even today, many cultures still rely heavily on binaries. Within them, the individual often retreats to a 'paradise' of romantic elements—constructs of imagined perfection.

For many, this paradise represents a sustained emotional or physical state, free of pain or injustice—a realm of perpetual fairness, happiness, and tranquillity. And although some societies have managed to break free from the oppressive triad of power, granting broader rights to individuals and ensuring a greater degree of equality before the law, binary thinking still dominates. It prevails even among those engaged in public affairs.

It is clear that the implementation of justice in its 'fantastical' sense remains, to this day, an impossibility—incapable of aligning with the intricate nature of human behaviour, or of adapting to the multiplicity of cultures, political dynamics, military conflicts, or personal struggles. Binary thinking, then, is nothing more than a form of naïve romanticism—a delusion that many still insist on maintaining.

A brief glance at human history reveals a landscape riddled with conflict and primitive behaviours—those which surface in times of war, famine, or existential threat.

From this, we can conclude that romantic idealism is an artificial construct-alien to our nature. Humans do not inhabit a planet filled with cartoonish characters. Life is not a tidy dichotomy of good and evil, justice and injustice, peace and war, right and wrong. Rather, it is a complex entanglement of all these elements—alongside countless others-working together, however chaotically, in service of continuity.
