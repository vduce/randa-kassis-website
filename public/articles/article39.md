<h4>Thought and Religion: Two Separate Paths</h4>

In Arab societies, the rational individual aspires to separate religion from politics, hoping to replicate the secularisation experienced elsewhere. Yet upon closer examination, it becomes clear that a more urgent demand precedes this political aim: the total and unconditional separation of religion from thought itself.

We all strive for knowledge to uncover new horizons that can benefit both the individual and society. This pursuit requires a mode of thinking open to change—one that is not grounded in rigid, unchallengeable foundations. Embracing immutable principles, in contrast, contradicts the ever-shifting temporal and spatial contexts in which we live.

Let us begin by revisiting the concept of knowledge. This term is often so misused and confused that its essential meaning becomes obscured. Undoubtedly, knowledge is built upon accessible information. As the neurologist Jean-Didier Vincent Naccache explains, 'Knowledge is the narrative of the I'. Each time we seek to discover the unknown or deepen our understanding of information in order to transform it into conceptual thought, we must place our convictions and beliefs to one side and be willing to revise them.

In each intellectual journey, we must shed the dictates of the 'I'—those beliefs and doctrines accumulated in our memory—which form a tyrannical and oppressive barrier, not unlike the Berlin Wall. To advance in knowledge, we must liberate ourselves from anything that hinders us. This is achievable only when we challenge the structure of the 'I', adopt a disposition open to other perspectives, and engage in a continual dual process of deconstruction and reconstruction.

The 'I' is composed of doctrines inherited from the broader collective culture. It acts as a container, enclosing the individual beneath layers of received beliefs, ideas, and assumptions. This broader cultural framework is further overlaid with the familial and educational environments in which we are raised, and all of this interacts with the biological makeup of the individual. The external environment plays a significant role in activating specific genetic expressions. To reach a deeper understanding of facts that lie outside these inherited containers, we must distance ourselves from this constructed 'I' and begin to peel away its accumulated layers.

Some argue that it is ethically necessary for religion to remain the ultimate arbiter of thought, attributing to it an authority that transcends all universal frameworks. They begin with praise for the sublimity of religious wisdom, claiming its non-human origins as the cornerstone of true knowledge, and proceed to justify the confinement of the individual within a collective mould. Their argument typically ends with a moralistic sermon that continues beyond death itself.

And since we are asked to respect the views of others in the name of understanding, we are often compelled to listen to confused, regurgitated ideas—cloaked in flowery prose and moralistic clichés—that lack novelty and are increasingly out of tune with our time.

Let us examine the foundations of religion more closely. It operates primarily through psychological mechanisms that stir conflicting emotions such as fear and tranquillity, terror and safety. Moreover, religion is devoid of discoveries. Its fossilisation in divine texts explains how religious discourse became closed in on itself, shackled by the very language and concepts that once gave it meaning. It has become its own prisoner, incapable of evolving—a system defined by its immutability.

For this reason, religion fails to inspire or participate in the process of discovery, which is the essence of knowledge. Knowledge emerges through exploration—through the synthesis of analysis, observation, and interpretation of the external world. This synthesis forms the basis for theories that must then be tested and revised. It is therefore neither practical nor logical to build knowledge upon immutable foundations. The mutable and provisional require flexible principles—ones that can be revised, even overturned. Here lies the fundamental problem: religion, by its nature, stands outside the domain of knowledge and thought.

Thus, I find the call to separate religion from knowledge essential. Such separation establishes a protected intellectual space where creativity, innovation, and free thought can flourish. It also fosters a social climate conducive to the productive exchange of ideas.

Many philosophers have attempted to define the conditions of thought—David Hume, for example, explored the link between knowledge and sensory impressions. He argued that knowledge is neither precise nor innate, as it depends on individual perception and is reinforced by repetition and experience.

Today, biology offers a more grounded explanation than those proposed by early philosophers. Additionally, psychoanalysis and experimental neurology have expanded our understanding of the nervous system, helping us avoid cognitive errors and expand our mental capacities.

Contemporary biology offers us a more robust explanation than those put forward by earlier philosophers. Nor should we overlook the contributions of psychoanalysis, particularly in its reliance on experimental neurology to understand the structure and functions of the nervous system. These advances have broadened our capacity to avoid errors, making us less prone to them and more adept at recognising and correcting them. When individuals or groups adhere rigidly to immutable principles that inhibit their ability to learn, such an attitude stifles the brain’s neural development—a process that thrives on learning. It is for this reason that individuals who remain confined within the boundaries of their own fixed concepts struggle to accept challenging ideas or confront disruptive events. This intellectual rigidity results in a kind of stagnation—a mental standstill in which the individual is unable to live in their time or adapt to the transformations occurring within it. The richness of thought cannot flourish without the nourishment of diverse experiences and the stimulus of collective intellectual exchange. This is why we assert that religion must be restored to its proper domain: the realm of emotion and feeling.

There is no doubt that each of us perceives the world and external reality in unique ways, for perception itself is constructed through mental visualisations shaped by our convictions and interpretations—those ideas accumulated and expressed in the form of the 'I'. We must continuously strive to reassess the data upon which this inner structure is built. Such reassessment is possible only through critical inquiry, an ongoing openness to ideas that differ from our own, and a willingness to acknowledge both our fallibility and the inherently limited, provisional nature of the knowledge and awareness we possess. For error and awareness are inextricably linked—they represent the sum of our efforts to reach a more expansive consciousness of all that lies beyond us.
