<h4>Tunisia on Life Support</h4>

For decades, Arab regimes have succeeded in numbing the collective consciousness of their peoples through a range of tactics: repression, violence, exile—whether abroad or beneath the soil—and the systematic marginalisation of those who remained on the land. All this has served one ultimate goal: the entrenchment of absolute power. In pursuit of this goal, these governments have deliberately silenced knowledge and stifled information that runs counter to the principle of domination, preventing it from reaching the public domain.

At the root of this insatiable urge to dominate and subjugate lies a fragile ego—an anxious self, lost in its own narrow corridors. It is an ego impoverished in knowledge, famished for biological and psychological gratification, and too weak to find its place within the collective.

These regimes suffer from a form of political neurosis, projecting onto the world the drama of their internal disarray. They draw upon their cultural surroundings to construct an illusory heroic archetype, one they graft onto their own deficient sense of self—an ego incapable of dialogue or exchange with others. As a result, they constantly require conflict, whether internal or—if geography and geopolitics allow—external, to assert their dominance and tighten their grip on those beneath their rule.

Despotism often enlists the beast of religious fundamentalism, subtly and strategically. It is deployed as needed—a weapon of fear, a brittle stick used to bludgeon opponents.

Arab regimes, without exception, have played a significant role in nurturing Islamic fundamentalist movements. Cloaked in a superficial secularism, they deceive themselves into believing in a legitimacy they once seized by force.

Thus, those who live under ignorant, hypocritical regimes—regimes that feed religious fundamentalism—are right to rebel. It is a right as basic as survival itself. And if the cost of breaking free from authoritarianism must be a period of fundamentalist rule, that cost is no greater than the deathlike stillness these embalmed regimes have imposed upon us.

Better that we prepare ourselves, however grim the next phase may be, than to be dragged into it unprepared—from one form of death to another, more insidious. Iraq offers a cautionary tale.

Once the wall of fear is broken—even just once—new uprisings become not only possible but inevitable. Fear loses its grip with each blow struck against it.

The Tunisian uprising is the convulsion of a body on the verge of death—lashing out to shatter death’s grip, reclaiming the right to live, and rejecting the quietude of the grave. It is the collective will refusing to vanish.

When the conditions for a dignified life are stripped away, when the individual is reduced to a passive recipient—a scapegoat for the nourishment of a tyrannical ego—then the gamble of change becomes not only an act of hope, but a necessary step. Such a leap demands the annihilation of fear: the fear of the unknown, the fear of the Islamist spectre.

Perhaps these societies must pass through the dark tunnel of religious fundamentalism, fall into the claws of the monster, and emerge with newfound immunity. The encounter may serve as a kind of vaccine—preparing them for future battles against authoritarian viruses, whether embodied in clergy or crowned in thrones.

We all dream of personal freedoms—of a life where individuals can sing their own songs freely. But this is only possible when ownership of the self is restored—when the individual regains the right to live and to die. Only then can the imagination begin to soar, wandering unbound. This rebirth of imagination must be preceded by individual fulfilment; only through it can we transcend the collective’s cognitive boundaries and take flight, a bird traversing all cultures.

To reach such a place, we must undertake a conscious act of resuscitation—of both the isolated individual and the suffocating reality that encircles them. They must be freed from the narrow confines that rob them of breath.

From this perspective, no one who holds freedom as their highest goal can lend support to any authority that represses the self or shackles the imagination under the pretext of fighting the 'other devil' of religious fundamentalism.

Many societies—including Arab ones—are plagued by neurotic anxieties, especially the fear of religious extremism. To overcome such disorders and uproot authoritarian thought at its core, we must confront what we fear. Only by facing it can we dissolve the deep-seated mental images infused with accumulated dread of the unknown.

Turning to the 'coping' theory proposed by Folkman and Lazarus—which helps us understand how individuals behave within their environments—we find that people are not passive before external demands. Rather, they actively engage with their surroundings, interpreting events and developing strategies to adapt. Some of these strategies focus on solving the problem directly; others address the underlying conditions that give rise to it.

Rebellion, then, in all its forms, is the individual’s positive declaration of selfhood—an eruption after all strategies of accommodation and quiet change have failed.

Every moment of despair contains the seed of hope. Death and life are deeply intertwined; there is no life without death, no light without darkness.

The people of Tunisia, in an instinctive, uncoordinated surge, chose to return to life. They rose up against their bloodsuckers, defying the fear of death in order to live again. They took the first step towards reviving awareness and embracing the spirit of risk and rebellion in the face of the unknown—perhaps offering a living example to other societies paralysed by fear, resigned to their artificial respirators, and reluctant to change.
