<h4>Ardi Between Darwin and Religion</h4>

I have long wondered why Arab societies remain distant from scientific facts, and why myth and religious legend continue to exert such magnetic pull. Over time, I’ve come to see that the root of the problem lies in the inability of our journalists and editors to relay information with accuracy. Instead, they often distort facts to align with their personal beliefs and psychological predispositions.

The issue, then, begins not with abstract forces, but with individuals in positions of influence-those who feel entitled to reshape knowledge as they see fit, distilling and twisting it to fit within the confines of their faith. Most editors and journalists at major newspapers and official websites, widely read across the region, share with their financial backers a disheartening ignorance when it comes to interpreting scientific and cultural material.

This naturally raises questions about their linguistic competence in foreign languages and, more broadly, their credibility in conveying knowledge. Personally, I suspect a deeper intellectual deficiency.

Just days ago, I was astonished by how Arab media outlets handled the recent scientific discovery of Ardi. This discovery, in every respect, supports the theory of evolution-yet it was portrayed in a way that suggested otherwise. Their ideological leanings led them to twist the findings to feed the gods of ignorance and regression.

Let us briefly turn to Ardi-a female hominid who lived approximately 4.4 million years ago, and who may well represent the closest known ancestor to the common forebear of humans and great apes, including chimpanzees, as noted by anthropologist Tim White.

Darwin laid the foundations of evolutionary theory and natural selection, opening a new pathway to knowledge. Science, of course, did not stop with him, nor does it rest satisfied with the unearthing of recent fossils. It remains a vigilant observer, a relentless seeker, always pursuing truths without claiming finality. Unlike the divine hypothesis, which insists on absolute constancy, science embraces uncertainty and revision.

The idea of a mythical god-the creator of all things-finds its roots in an era that predates spiritual consciousness. If we examine its origins, we discover that early humans, lacking the tools to understand their environment, attempted to explain natural phenomena through personified forces. Their ignorance, mingled with fear and desire, gave rise to imagined spirits and powers that eventually became gods. In this way, myth carved a pathway to divinity, infiltrating and, over time, dominating its meaning.

Looking back at ancient civilisations, we see that the concept of a divine hero or god-king formed the basis of the creator god. At the time, sorcerers were able to expand their political-and later religious-influence over communities paralysed by fear and ignorance. Today’s god still draws his authority from the ignorance of individuals and the limits of their imagination, assuming the role of eternal executioner and ultimate tyrant.

The magical god and the creator god are, in essence, one and the same-both sustained by the primitive mindsets of early communities. The fundamental basis of all deities rests on internal psychological drives interacting with the external environment-between an individual’s thoughts, often saturated with fantasy, and the surrounding material world.

In ancient societies, the unique experiences of certain individuals-whether through social insight or the capacity to diagnose and treat illness-allowed them to dominate the collective. These figures were elevated first to the status of sorcerers, and later to divine rulers.

But what, exactly, are the rules of magic?

James Frazer divided magic into two categories:
– a negative form, expressed through taboos,
– and a positive form, expressed through sorcery.

Together, these formed the structural pillars of the divine.

Sorcery says: “Do this to obtain that.”

Taboo warns: “Do not do this, or misfortune will befall you.”

In both cases, the goal is the same: to secure what is desirable and avoid what is harmful. In this sense, the objectives of magic and religion are identical. Just as magic calls for rituals, chants, and sometimes sacrifices, religion demands worship and devotion.

The sorcerer’s power depended on upholding magical rites. Through this control of ritual, he was able to secure his place within the tribe and often ascend to political or spiritual leadership. The god, too, sustains his dominance through the worship of individuals and groups. Magical rituals gradually evolved into religious rites, but the function remained largely unchanged. Faith became a tool to control both body and mind. 

The deeper people sank into religious devotion, the more their psychological constitution yielded to illusion and myth. This not only impaired their ability to absorb scientific knowledge, but also eroded their capacity to understand others. Trapped in a narrow mental space, they became prisoners of their own fearful imaginings.

One can easily understand why, in later periods, religion turned against magic. The two had coexisted for some time, often working in tandem. But eventually, religion emerged as the dominant force. Still, their foundations remain linked. Just as the sorcerer once claimed to mediate with spirits, so too does the religious authority today-only now, it is not just the clerics, but much of Arab society that serves as agents for religion and its god.

I return now to our newspapers-Al Jazeera, Al-Quds Al-Arabi-and their credibility when it comes to science, knowledge, and information. Their intellectual barrenness in handling facts, and their simplistic attempts at manipulating the minds of their readership, are astonishing.

I can only offer two explanations:

Either a profound ignorance of foreign languages, or a deliberate distortion aimed at affirming belief in God.
