In order to act effectively against all that obstructs the path of progress and paralyses modern intelligence, we must collectively strive for a better understanding of the roots of ignorant and regressive thought. Residual ideas inherited from bygone centuries—ideas that hurl us back to prehistoric times—must be identified and discredited. This pursuit of understanding is not driven by a desire to respect these beliefs, but rather by the necessity to expose their savage origins and explain the extent to which they remain an entangled, confused snarl in the minds of individuals and groups who continue to uphold them.

Such was the stance of archaeologist and historian Salomon Reinach, who devoted his life’s work to dispelling the mists of residual beliefs across cultures. I took the liberty, in the paragraph above, of paraphrasing this idea from his voluminous study Cultes, mythes et religions (1905–1923). This serves as our entry point into the central theme of this article: an inquiry into the origins of the idea of god.

A careful examination of anthropological research and studies on the origins of myth enables us to uncover the deep roots of religion and the belief systems that predate the emergence of the god-concept. These pagan beliefs ought not to be dissociated from the history of religions, for they constituted fertile ground for their birth and growth. If, at their origin, religions fed upon and evolved from the infantile and naïve imagination of early civilisations, they later acquired strength and eventually imposed themselves as powerful authorities over hearts and minds.

The notion of a primitive god finds its source in the concept of the totem. Many anthropologists agree on the universality of the totemic system, which was by no means limited to the native populations of Australia and the Americas.

Let us begin with a brief overview of the totemic system itself. It is a tribal structure grounded in a series of taboos, which may be summarised—according to Durkheim, Reinach, Frazer and others—as practices centred around the veneration of a chosen animal, or in rare instances, a plant or specific inanimate object.

The totem, at its core, rests upon an elusive and enigmatic contract based on shared beliefs between a particular group of people and the animals under their guardianship. Reinach observed that the totemic system arose alongside archaic Homo sapiens. This early veneration of the totem animal waned and eventually disappeared as human societies transitioned from the hunter-gatherer phase to agriculture and sedentary life.

Studies examining this shift have identified strikingly similar traits and processes across cultures and civilisations, from ancient Greece to Egypt and Syria. Within the totemic system, the tribal animal is designated as an object of prohibition. It may only be killed on a specific day of the year, and always in the presence of the entire tribe. Special ceremonies and rituals—marked by scenes of mourning and grief—accompany the slaughter of the totem animal.

A close reading of the reports compiled by Spencer and Gillen on the subject of totemism highlights some of its direct consequences, such as the emergence of exogamy and the gradual prohibition of incest. Reinach also noted that, in some civilisations, the later emergence of the personified god was accompanied by human sacrifice intended to resurrect and renew life. These practices trace their origins to the sanctity of the totem animal. Frazer’s work on tribal traditions—many of which survive today as rituals stripped of their original emotional significance—shows that such rituals were grounded in the belief that supernatural powers were transferred to the human who consumed the totem animal’s flesh. From an anthropological standpoint, these rites were underpinned by the idea that the flesh of the totem animal—the tribe’s protector—bestowed extraordinary powers upon the consumer. Remnants of this belief can still be found today in various cultures. In certain regions of China, for example, the genitals of specific animals are consumed in the belief that they enhance sexual potency.

It is worth reminding readers that, for the Māori, male genitals symbolise life, whereas female genitals represent death. In some Chinese traditions, the consumption of male animal genitals is likewise associated with vitality and energy. Here, we must underline the dialectical relationship between internal psychological drives and the external experiences that led many societies to adopt such beliefs.

One may draw some consolation from the thought that early humans’ ignorance of the biological mechanisms of reproduction led them to develop notions of reincarnation through animals and plants. The earliest hypothesis explaining the development of totemism rests on the idea of a continuous flow of life between humans and their totem animals. The totem animal was considered a full member of the tribe and endowed with sacred qualities.

Yet from this original sacred regard for the totem animal, we eventually moved to indiscriminate and collective slaughter. The killing of the totem animal was not seen as a sacrifice to any deity—for the simple reason that the concept of god had not yet been born.

The notion of sacrifice to the gods emerged gradually, alongside humanity’s slow progression from savagery to agrarian life. With this shift, animals began to lose their sacred aura, and more significantly, humans began to develop feelings of revulsion towards certain creatures.

If we consult the writings of Robertson Smith and Salomon Reinach on the sacralisation of animals among the ancient peoples of Greece, Rome, Syria and Egypt, we find, for instance, that wild boars were considered sacred in ancient Syria. This may shed light on the origin of the prohibition against pork among Jews and Muslims, both of whom originally lived in that part of the world. The emotions and affects originally associated with the sanctity of the animal gradually inverted, yet the notion of prohibition persisted. It is important to note that feelings of disgust and hatred can, at times, serve as necessary tools to sever our emotional connection to the original sacred significance of the totem animal.

I have not yet exhausted my list of examples supporting the deep-rootedness of totemic systems within our cultures, and there is more to come in the second part of this article.
