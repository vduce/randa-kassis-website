<h4>In the Beginning was the Totem Animal — Part II</h4>

In a previous article, I began my exploration of the origins of the totem. In this second part, I will turn to a closely related subject: the question of the taboo—a notion intimately tied to the earliest human reactions to fatal natural phenomena.

Let us begin with a brief glance at the process by which individual inferences are abstracted into sweeping generalisations. We know that these personal inferences consist of a composite of cognitive images lodged in long-term memory. These images retain the emotional and affective charge present when the original inferences were made. At a later stage, the brain reorganises images with shared attributes stored in the latent memory, and these re-emerge in the form of actual behaviour.

Undoubtedly, each one of us perceives reality through the lens of our individual imagination, the quality of which varies according to our experiences. What distinguishes a conscious individual—one who seeks to enrich their knowledge and understanding—from another who remains shackled to imposed experiences is this: the desire to expand one’s imagination through science and knowledge, rather than yielding to the consequences of ignorance and sweeping generalisations.

Primitive humans instinctively prohibited that which they did not understand, as a means of avoiding danger—an entirely rational survival response. The taboo did not arise from an individual or collective intent to regulate social life. For this reason, in its early stages, the taboo was not associated with punishment meted out by the group to those who violated it. Rather, it was believed that the taboo itself could bring about death to anyone who touched or approached it, whether deliberately or inadvertently. The taboo did not denote an action; instead, it implied prohibition in a fundamental sense—it acted not as a motivator, but as a restraint. This is the key distinction between the taboo and the later emergence of religious laws, which transformed the original meaning of taboo into systems of moral and legal codes. The affects and psychological states of fear and dread underpin the rise of the taboo, which functioned as a totalising and uniform explanation for all recurring phenomena caused by the natural world.

Let us return to the relationship between primitive humans and nature. While today we might regard this bond as a sign of philosophical or ecological advancement, it did not stem from any conscious recognition that humans formed part of nature, nor from any sense of harmony with other living beings. Rather, it was rooted in psychological states shaped by a deep sense of powerlessness and lack of control over the forces of nature.

There is no doubt that the human need for many ancient myths and fables has waned over time. Perhaps humanity simply grew weary of repeating the same failed experiences, eventually realising that rituals grounded in sorcery and shamanism had not succeeded in mastering the external world (what we now refer to as the external or empirical experience). When this external experience clashes with inner consciousness, a confused mind—unable to resolve the consequences of this confrontation between inner and outer forces—often defaults to supernatural interpretations.

Historical records offer numerous examples of how, during the post-agricultural and pastoral stages of evolution, humans used animals to detect danger or locate water sources. These early humans may have come to recognise the keenness of animal senses. The Roman historian Tacitus, for instance, observed that ancient Jews venerated donkeys, referencing a tale in which a wild variant of this animal led Moses to a water spring. In the same account, Tacitus offers insight into the sacrificial ritual involving a calf—seen as an act of vengeance against the ancient Egyptians, who revered the sacred bull Apis.

From this, we may trace the roots of the totemic system to the very regions in which the Abrahamic religions would later arise. The totemic structure evolved alongside each stage of human development, from hunting and gathering to agriculture and settled farming.

Returning to the notion of taboo and its connection with totemism, we must consider its profound influence on the Abrahamic faiths. The taboo was defined by the prohibition of contact with the sacred totem. In some ancient tribes, and as noted by Durkheim, a woman who had just given birth was considered a taboo object for forty days due to the presence of blood—believed to be the essence or spirit of life. Here, we encounter a link with the notion of blood ties, which continue to underpin tribal loyalties and emotional allegiances. This association between taboo and blood offers a vital clue to the concept of the primitive god. Even today, menstrual and postpartum blood remain subjects of prohibition in many Muslim cultures, where women are not permitted to pray or fast during such periods. As outlined in the first part of this article, the feeling of disgust and corruption tied to the taboo stems from a psychological reaction to the loss of its original sacred dimension. This unconscious association is powerful and not easily resolved, yet it continues to manifest in cultural and religious practices around the world.

And since we are on the subject of women, it is worth mentioning the Roman pagan tradition of whipping women with rods—an ancient ritual that endured until at least the 5th century and coincides, in modern times, with Valentine’s Day. On the fifteenth day of the second month, young men (and later priests) would roam the streets of Ancient Rome with rods, flogging women they encountered. It was believed that such flagellation promoted fertility. This practice was not confined to the Roman Lupercalia festival but echoes other traditions recorded by anthropologists like Thompson, Frazer, and Reinach, where animals were flogged to enhance their reproductive capabilities.

Given the deep entrenchment of taboo in the fabric of social organisation, it is important to consider how its meaning has shifted over the centuries, and how its influence continues in laws governing punishment and moral codes. Transgressors of the taboo were seen as contaminated, and punishment served to prevent that contamination from spreading to the wider group.

This fear of contagion became the primary catalyst for the emergence of guilt within human societies, linking closely with the idea of purification and the expiation of sin. In the Akakios tribe in Africa, sinners undergo rigorous rituals to rid themselves of guilt. They confess to the tribal sorcerer, who oversees a ceremony beginning with the sinner vomiting—a symbolic purging of inner corruption. This association between the physical act of emptying the body and the spiritual notion of cleansing suggests that guilt was once conceived as a corporeal affliction, not a matter of conscience. Here again, we encounter the concept of the scapegoat: rather than punishing the guilty party, an innocent animal is sacrificed to redeem the sin.

The scapegoat motif appears in many societies that pre-date the Abrahamic religions. Plutarch recounts a public punishment in the city of Chaeronea in which a slave’s genitals were whipped while his tormentors cried: ‘Depart from our city, oh famine, and come to us, oh health and plenty!’

Though these customs may seem absurd to us today, they emerged during the agricultural phase of human evolution. Totemic remnants were gradually transformed into spiritual doctrines, evolving into ideas of divine punishment and reward, and manifesting in religious rituals—from scapegoating to collective prayer for rain. Climate, too, played a crucial role in maintaining these totemic beliefs. More significantly, however, we find that the natural and cultural environment continues to reinforce them. In societies where basic needs and desires are met, the longing for deeper understanding tends to flourish. The fulfilment of biological necessities often paves the way for a more vibrant and inquisitive intellectual life.
