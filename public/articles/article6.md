<h4>Turkey: Is It Still Our Ally?</h4>

To combat the Islamic State (IS)-that totalitarian monstrosity intent on subjugating the Middle East and, ultimately, the world-ten regional powers signed the “Jeddah Communiqué,” pledging to support President Barack Obama’s campaign against IS. But one key signature was missing: that of Turkey under President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.

When US Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel attempted to persuade Turkey to join the international coalition, Ankara flatly refused. In doing so, it disrupted the core of Atlantic solidarity. Not only did Turkey decline to participate militarily, but it also prohibited American and NATO aircraft-those best placed to reach Iraq-from taking off from its airbases.

Let us recall: the Turkish air force is equipped with cutting-edge American military technology, its pilots are trained by the United States, and Turkey hosts 24 NATO bases. Until 20 September, Erdoğan’s official justification was the fate of 46 Turkish hostages captured by IS in Mosul in July. We now know they were released in exchange for Turkish assistance to jihadist forces fighting Kurds in Syria.

This hostage narrative concealed a far more troubling reality-one utterly incompatible with the values of an “ally” that claims to oppose terrorism, seeks EU membership, and remains a pillar of NATO. Erdoğan’s Turkey has actively supported Islamist terrorist groups in both Syria and Iraq, including IS, which counts over 1,000 Turkish nationals among its ranks.

Since the outbreak of the Syrian civil war, Ankara has turned a blind eye to IS training camps on Syrian soil and has facilitated the flow of weapons and jihadists through its territory. These fighters, hailing from across the globe, pass freely through Turkey en route to the battlefields of Syria and Iraq. Many are recruited openly, in mosques, schools, and even among Turkey’s security services.

The Turkish government’s support for IS has been openly denounced by the opposition (notably the Republican People’s Party, CHP), which laments that their nation has become a sanctuary for jihadists. One such group, the powerful Naqshbandi Islamist Brotherhood, maintains close ties with Erdoğan’s ruling AKP.

Does the neo-Sultan in Ankara loathe the Alawite Bashar al-Assad more than he fears IS? Or is he aligning himself with jihadists-who, like him, are nostalgic for the Caliphate-against the secular Alawite Syrians, just as he politically opposes their Alevi cousins in Turkey, whom he equally deems “infidels”?

In recent weeks, Turkey has behaved more like an ally of IS than a NATO partner. It stood by as Kurdish forces in Syria-under-equipped and under-supported-faced IS onslaughts, notably in Kobane. Turkish tanks and heavy weaponry reportedly fell into the hands of IS fighters. Moreover, Turkey has refused to curb the smuggling of hydrocarbons from fields and refineries controlled by IS in Iraq and Syria, a trade that generates an estimated $2 million daily for the group.

Erdogan’s ambiguous and complicit role can no longer be denied.

The United States and NATO, ever quick to condemn Russia over Iran or Ukraine, must show equal resolve in confronting a supposed ally that flouts every norm of Western solidarity. As a prominent NATO member, Turkey cannot plead neutrality.

Faced with a threat as grave as IS-arguably the most dangerous enemy of democracy since the Third Reich and the USSR-Erdoğan and his Prime Minister, Ahmet Davutoğlu, architects of the “neo-Ottoman” vision, must take a clear stand: either Turkey remains within the Alliance and commits fully to the coalition against IS, ceasing all material support to jihadists, or it must face the consequences of acting as an accomplice to Islamist barbarity.

Likewise, NATO must finally adopt a consistent stance. Since 1974, the Alliance has tolerated Turkey’s occupation of 37% of Cyprus-an EU member state-as well as its continuous violations of Greek airspace, especially over the Aegean. It can no longer turn a blind eye to Ankara’s overt support for jihadist forces, a fact even the staunchest Kemalists condemn.

France, which rejoined NATO’s Integrated Command in 2009 after its withdrawal in 1966 under General de Gaulle, must take a stand. If Turkey refuses to clarify its position, should we continue to tolerate Erdoğan’s duplicitous machinations?
