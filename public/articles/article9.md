<h4>The Islamisation of the Uprising and the Loss of Syria</h4>

Since its eruption, the Syrian uprising—confronting a totalitarian regime—has struggled to win over ethnic and religious minorities, as well as other groups wary of losing the individual freedoms they had under Assad should Islamists rise to power. Various factors have fuelled the fears and hesitation of these communities. Chief among them is a growing sense of hopelessness that any genuine social or cultural transformation will take place, particularly given the territorial and societal inroads made by religious rebels, who have managed to penetrate the very fabric of Syrian society. The censorship imposed on individuals has allowed radical religious currents to infiltrate daily life, becoming a last refuge for many. The psychological toll inflicted by the regime’s repressive mechanisms has stripped individuals of the capacity to envision self-sufficient ways of improving their conditions. Faced with these frustrations—present at every level of society—it is understandable that many seek refuge in religion as a means of coping with their daily realities, a way to compensate for their losses, even if this compensation is illusory or unrealistic. This pattern is often seen in societies subjected to totalitarian oppression.

Islamists in Syria are increasingly descending upon the popular movement, positioning themselves as the strongest and most widespread current among the Syrian factions, relying heavily on the religious and conservative foundations of certain communities. Their prominence stems, firstly, from the belief among many Syrians involved in the uprising that the international community has abandoned them, leaving them vulnerable to the regime’s brutality. Secondly, it arises from the Islamists’ strategic exploitation of the Syrian psyche, allowing them to infiltrate the public sphere in a systematic and organised manner. Moreover, their control over the distribution of aid and humanitarian supplies has substantially bolstered their visibility in public squares and streets, giving the impression that they have monopolised the uprising. They have seized upon the division between communities previously favoured by the regime and those they refer to as the majority, reinforcing sectarian discrimination and fuelling hostility and estrangement between these groups, all in a bid to widen their base. They also invoke the notion of a “strongest majority,” asserting that such a majority has the right to dictate society’s direction and values. It is essential here to question how they define both majority and minority, which, in their eyes, are homogenous and singular blocs.

Syrian society comprises non-Arab ethnic groups—possibly making up more than 15% of the population—as well as various religious and sectarian communities totalling around 20% or more. Even among the largest group, Sunni Arabs, there exists considerable diversity. It is inaccurate to treat Sufis, Salafists, and members of the Muslim Brotherhood as a monolithic bloc. Nor are all Islamists part of a single trend—Jihadi Salafists differ fundamentally from their non-Jihadi counterparts. Diverse interpretations of the Qur’an and the presence of multiple theological schools further illustrate the internal plurality of this group.

The Syrian equation extends far beyond the country’s borders, influenced by regional actors providing generous financial support to Islamist movements. This makes Islamists serious players on the Syrian stage, with considerable sway over the course of the uprising, often skewing it towards specific religious orientations. This is being done at the expense of other Syrian groups—who would constitute a majority if seen as a single bloc—willing to undertake comprehensive cultural, social, and intellectual reform.

It is important not to overlook the fact that secular Muslims represent a significant proportion of Syrian society. This necessitates a reassessment of the demographic and ideological blocs within Syria in order to reshape the political equation in favour of the secularists and their allies, thereby exposing the Islamists for what they are: a small minority with neither substantial political nor cultural weight inside the country.

Undoubtedly, Islamic parties that claim to be undergoing reform and re-evaluating their principles should be given a fair opportunity. Yet, to date, these parties have failed to translate their stated intentions into practical actions within Syria. Instead, they appear to be working relentlessly to marginalise any group or individual posing a credible alternative.

The principle of competition between forces with equal standing remains the greatest driver of enduring reform. It is this dynamic that allows for the refinement of social, economic, and political programmes aimed at improving the individual’s standard of living and expanding opportunities for personal creativity. This can only be achieved by adopting a framework of genuine partnership among all societal groups—beginning with a call for national reconciliation and the inclusion of all social components.

I believe that the primary responsibility for the ongoing violence rests with the regime, which has immersed itself in a so-called security solution. Secondly, blame lies with the Islamists, who are relentlessly working to Islamise the uprising, seeking to exclude diverse voices. Thirdly, the responsibility falls on the segments of Syrian society that continue to abstain from participation in the uprising, while simultaneously refusing to present themselves as legitimate partners.

We all bear responsibility for what is unfolding in Syria—from Assad’s crimes to the human rights abuses committed by elements within the opposition against regime supporters. We must now begin to denounce all violations committed by both sides and hold accountable anyone—individual or group—who incites public hostility against a particular community. The path to change begins with a firm commitment to the rights of all, and an embrace of diverse opinions.
