<h4>Infinite Slumber</h4>

Let me begin by addressing our religious friends who persist in preaching the virtues of their tolerant faith—declaring its openness to all the straying souls who have wandered from God’s flock. If God is indeed so merciful and generous, then surely His followers must exhibit patience towards those who hesitate—those who seek the truth not through blind adherence, but through their own intellectual effort and introspection, rather than rushing into the comfortable complacency of a preordained faith. And if this strong and mighty God is capable of guiding whomever He wishes, would that not suggest that one of the expressions of His divine wisdom is to bring forth individuals who do not believe in Him at all? If so, then believers ought to refrain from preaching, fall into silence, and surrender to the will of their God—He who, presumably, best understands the mysterious workings of the unknown.

What, then, is it that troubles the devout? Are they not content, basking in the infinite embrace of their Creator? Why, then, would they feel threatened by that which lies beyond the perimeters of their religious universe?

I believe the disquiet that some believers express towards non-believers stems from a deeper anxiety—a resentment towards the atheist’s ability to roam freely and unbound across divine realms, to explore the cosmos without restriction, in search of meaning, and perhaps to touch the essence of freedom itself. Those in bondage often desire nothing more than to see others shackled alongside them. They envy liberty even as they vilify it. And when they witness someone who has broken free from the chains of subjugation, they look on with bitterness and disdain. For the slave, freedom is neither understood nor realised—it exists only as a mirage, a dream beyond their grasp. Their intellect, long confined to the inscribed symbols and dogmas of their holy texts, is unable to interpret their own feelings and inner experiences. True understanding is not handed down; it is reached through affects—those internal movements that mediate between raw emotional energy and outward action.

Perception itself is a creative, generative force. But this is precisely what is absent in the religious mindset. Most believers lack the intellectual faculties to engage with the experience of creativity. Instead, they capitulate entirely to expressions and ideas that were formulated in another age, by others. The problem is not belief per se, but the docile and obedient mentality of the faithful—those who accept, without question, all that is dictated to them. They do not possess the tools to examine the world through the prisms of science or logic, nor do they make the effort to translate their experiences into independent understanding.

I often find myself wondering why it is that individuals from certain communities—particularly religious ones—find new ideas so deeply unsettling. This persistent resistance is symptomatic of a chronic pathology bound tightly to their conception of God and belief. Their God is imagined as immutable, absolute, flawless—a supreme entity whose perfection is central to their sense of identity. This image of the divine becomes a kind of psychological refuge: familiar, fixed, and immune to critique. The devout adorn this God with endless accolades, celebrating His strength and might. But is this God truly so powerful and omnipotent as they claim? Is He genuinely able to achieve anything, to grant His followers victory over all adversaries?

But let us first take a close look at this God from a purely objective perspective. Let us see how His own followers describe Him. This anthropomorphic God appears to suffer from a series of human psychological complexes—sadism, irritation, self-aggrandisement, and arrogant pride. Look at some of His ninety-nine “Beautiful Names”: Allah, Al-Muhaymin—the All-Seeing, the All-Powerful One; Al-Jabbar—the One under whose dominion nothing occurs except by His will. The word Jabbar literally signifies tyranny and oppression. Al-Mutakabbir—literally “the Haughty One,” here taken to signify God’s absolute elevation above His creatures. Al-Qahhar—the Subduer, who possesses perfect Power and is never incapable of anything. Al-Muthil—the One who bestows honour upon whomever He wills, such that no one can disgrace him; and who degrades whomever He wills, such that no one can elevate him. Al-Qawiyy—the One endowed with complete and unchallenged Power. Al-Muqtadir—the Omnipotent, from whom nothing can be withheld. Al-Muntaqim—the Avenger, who prevails over His enemies, punishes them for their sins, and has the power to destroy them.

This selection from Allah’s pantheon of “Beautiful Names” conjures not a divine and transcendent being, but rather a profoundly human figure—one burdened with psychological afflictions. And if we were to begin compiling an inventory of this God’s illnesses, I doubt we would reach the end of that list for days to come. Yet what matters more than the symptoms is understanding the cause of these chronic pathologies. In truth, these attributes have nothing to do with any actual God. They are projections of human conflict—of a desire by some to exert control and domination over the many, or even just over each other. In another sense, the concept of God is a direct result of humanity’s relentless pursuit of knowledge and perfection. God becomes the externalised and idealised embodiment of absolute mastery—an objectified idea of total knowledge and power, placed outside the self and set before it as an unattainable standard.

Let me return to the issue of God’s chronic pathologies, often misrepresented as His divine attributes. The morbid fascination with destruction and the hypocrisy masquerading as truthfulness and generosity are, in reality, human psychological maladies. These traits are characteristic of those who seek to control their fellow men and women through ruthless means. A defining feature of this collective (divine) ailment is the unwavering adherence to a singular perspective and a narrow field of vision. This constrained perception is incapable of acknowledging or understanding differing ideas and opinions; it is highly irritable and prone to violence, unhesitant in extinguishing anything that opposes it. Those who embody and perpetuate this mindset cannot conceive of thought beyond the confines of their religions and cultures. They are thus distanced from the merciful, peaceful, generous, and all-loving One. Am I mistaken in considering that the very existence of this One relies on the numbing and suppression of our intellects?

If my assessment of this God is flawed, perhaps due to my ignorance of His essence, would His followers not be better served by emulating His purported forgiveness, rather than exhibiting intolerance and hostility towards those who dissent? Why do they persistently defend their God? Is He not deemed capable of protecting Himself? By taking it upon themselves to determine the fate of non-believers, are they not contradicting their own teachings and casting doubt upon God’s omnipotence?

I suspect that, deep down, believers struggle to place their faith in such a frail and impotent deity, one incapable of harming even the smallest fly. They experience constant inner turmoil, torn between reason and myth, science and ignorance. Yet, driven by a profound desire to belong to a collective entity, they construct this divine edifice and embed it within their subconscious, where it transforms into a bottomless abyss. This is how they embark upon a doomed path—a journey marked by misery, resentment, and illusions. In this state, they find themselves unable to reconcile with their innate impulses and desires. These drives, seemingly banished from the external world, are indulged in secret, with pathological fervour. Indeed, they appear incapable of mastering their own biological needs.

According to Wilhelm Reich, the religious mechanisms to which inexperienced individuals and groups resort as a means to understand the world and interpret events can collapse at any moment. When this occurs, various opportunities to explore and comprehend life present themselves to the intellect. Life and liberty are not distinct entities, nor are they bestowed upon us; we can only approach them through successive attempts to understand and interpret them in rational and logical ways.

We must be vigilant of the subtle mechanisms of brainwashing employed by spiritual and political leaders, alongside the collective social body. Our most esteemed electronic platforms and print newspapers appear to engage actively in research and publication. However, the truth is that much of this has little to do with culture and freethinking. Their readers are continually dulled, inhaling the carcinogenic toxins of religious faith or being entertained with the usual tabloid stories. It is rather laughable when one repeatedly hears the question of why Arab nations remain incapable of participating in or contributing to development and progress. Such advancements can never emerge from a culture fixated on the immutable and divinely perfect One. The politics of oppression, whether exercised by religious or political power, share the same origins and causes. We cannot demand any form of freedom without securing the intellectual and cultural liberty of the individual. We need to embrace individualism and the emancipation of men and women from all obstacles and chains that hinder their creative impulses. We must adopt ethics born from the self and diminish the influence of mandatory ethics instilled by religious texts. Perhaps we should construct our ethics on a more open and comprehensive connection with all living creatures, rather than with a god of our own making.

Now, more than ever, we need to shake off the dust of fear from our deepest thoughts. We must reject all forms of power that seek to shackle the individual, keeping them humiliated and subjected to perpetual slavery. No ethical foundation can be found in a man or woman stripped of their humanity, ensconced in their religious, racial, or gendered shell. If both believers and atheists among us are united in the pursuit of defeating oppression and injustice, then we must oppose all its forms and practices. There is no freedom without reliance on self-criticism, inference, and judgment—all of which must originate from the individual themselves. We need to believe in ourselves first, and then delve deeper into our human depths to find that little ego disguised as a god.

In conclusion, I can only say that our Arab cultures will always remain subjected to humiliation and oppression as long as they possess nothing other than god. Our cultures, with their diverse yet antagonistic religious faiths, derive their sole solace from the false pride of being the cradle of three major religions, of being god’s chosen people—the people He has elected to remain tucked by His side, lost in their infinite slumber.
