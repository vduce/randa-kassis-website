<h4>Religion… and the Projection of Infantile Instincts Part I</h4>

The fantasies which overwhelm our rational thinking are, in their essence, the fruits of a mental image that compensates for disappointments or psychological anxiety. When freed from restrictions and external taboos, these fantasies are given free rein, evolving into imaginary fictions that gradually develop and solidify into influential narratives with far-reaching implications for our lives and ways of thinking. They give birth to all kinds of monsters, gods, and demons.

But where does this imaginary mental image come from?

Psychological anthropology has revealed to us the source of these stories, which are primarily rooted in childhood. The child’s reliance on the external world inspires a feeling of instability and cautiousness, which in turn breeds anxiety and psychological aggression towards the other. This plays a dominant role. Such feelings manifest themselves more clearly in dreams or during therapeutic sessions undergone by patients suffering from mental illness. But without doubt, they are even more visible in myths, legends, gods, and religions.

Let us return to the condition of infancy—out of which these fictional images grew and developed over time into mythological religions. Of course, we must examine them from a rational perspective—that is, beyond the sentimental realm inherited through rote learning and prolonged brainwashing.

Certainly, we cannot attribute the emergence of religions and gods to a single factor. No one reason alone explains the phenomenon. Rather, a variety of influential elements interact—manifesting differently among individuals and groups. More precisely, individual psychological factors operate in interplay with genetic, environmental, and collective influences. Religions are a psychological sum that began with the natural catastrophes endured by all living species, continuing through the emergence of the first humans and their gradual biological evolution.

Many will reject this thesis—that suffering has been internalised within the human collective unconscious—as implausible or irrelevant. Science has yet to provide an irrefutable mechanism to explain how this internalisation and transmission occurred. Yes, we have competing theories, some of which cancel each other out. However, I am dumbfounded by individuals and institutions that dismiss reason and scientific thinking outright, and yet do not hesitate to exploit the gaps in scientific knowledge. They cling to whatever fragment supports their religious doctrines—while ignoring everything else.

I can understand one scientific theory being used to criticise or refute another on the basis of insufficient evidence. What I cannot understand is when individuals and groups, who live and breathe fables, who fear God and Satan, who are convinced of divine unknowns and predestination, suddenly invoke scientific evidence—evidence they neither understand nor respect—solely to challenge theories that contradict their beliefs and to validate the accuracy of their myths.

Such people can only be described as photocopying machines of rote information. More than that, their behaviour, ideas, and moral codes betray an impotence to acknowledge the primary importance of the sexual instinct. And it is this particular aspect—so often neglected by believers in their selective and cunning appeals to science—that I wish to emphasise.

These people can see and interpret only through the lens of what has been forbidden by an emasculated god. To compensate for this divine impotency, they impose a masculine ascendancy founded upon the marginalisation—and eventual erasure—of femininity.

Let us delve into the fundamentals of gods and demons, and explore the duality of good and evil. These dualities, I argue, are all derived from the sexual instinct. This is why the prohibition and distortion of instincts and drives are necessary for fables to exert control over the human mind. To achieve a balanced and healthy cognitive state, we must understand the cognitive origins of myths—and reconcile ourselves with our instincts.

Let us journey through the meanderings of myth, as found among Aboriginal Indian tribes, and consider stories recorded by anthropological studies of the ancient inhabitants of the Andaman Islands, in order to extract their hidden meanings. According to Roheim, the Andaman myth is centred on the figure of the primitive All-Father, Puluga. As in Freud’s account of the father of the primal horde, Puluga monopolised all the women of the tribe to satisfy his sexual needs. Over time, the men (the sons) rose up and killed Puluga, replacing the original paternal tyranny with new laws governing sexual relations. The theme of patricide runs through many myths. It was on this pattern that Freud formulated his thesis regarding the origins of morality, tied to the guilt complex.

Every sexual relationship is founded on this archetypal act of guilty reconciliation with the murdered father. Paradoxically, it is this act that reaffirms paternal authority through the prohibition of incest—first between mother and son, then between siblings.

Let us take a closer look at these myths, which suggest that the son’s sexual desire for his mother may have been reciprocated. The mystery of the mother’s pregnancy—without direct intercourse with her son—appears frequently in totemic, Greek, and other mythologies.

We must grasp the nature of this unique bond between mother and son. This was the first taboo, established even before the prohibition of incest between siblings, or between father and daughter. One might argue that the father’s ignorance of his own role in procreation contributed to the delayed emergence of these latter taboos.

Analytical studies of neuroses in the field of psychological anthropology show that the first masculine anxiety stems from the castration complex—not before, but during intercourse. The fear of the female sexual organ (experienced during the act) becomes confused with the fear of castration (which should precede it). These are two distinct anxieties, but they collapse into a single moment and are experienced anachronistically. Likewise, the child’s longing to return to the maternal womb reflects a paradox—simultaneous sexual desire and fear.

In the myth of Biliku (a female spider), the mother figure represents protection from danger. Tarai (a monitor lizard) is both son and husband—subject to her authority, yet complicit with her. 

(Notably, Biliku and Tarai are also the Andaman names for the two dominant monsoon winds.) The mother-son relationship here reflects mutual sexual desire maintained in a perpetual state of tension. In Freudian terms, this becomes the inner conflict between the superego—associated with religion and morality—and the feminine principle, which represents libido and a return to primal instinct. Perhaps this is why spiritual religions have granted women a privileged yet restricted role, often as objects of sexual temptation.

One might say that the marginalisation of the feminine, the reduction of her role to procreation, and the denial of her sexual agency all stem from this ambiguous relationship between mother and son. On one hand, there is the son’s fear of and desire for the mother; on the other, the mother’s control, her protective nature—and her penis envy, expressed through a persistent drive to compensate for lack.
