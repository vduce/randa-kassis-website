<h4>The Search for the Creator</h4>

This human machine awakens from a prolonged slumber, striving to retrieve its history and return to memories buried deep within for thousands of years. Yet it fails to grasp the imprints of its past—those inscribed within nature itself. Desperately, it turns to its stones, seeking to triumph over nature and assert itself as the pioneer. But it freezes each time it attempts to reach into the depths of its own self. Enraged, it unleashes its fury upon its own limbs, cursing the individual and surrendering to mythic fantasy. It declares wars between its parts, as each seeks to prove its superiority over the other.

Here is humankind: after creating a god for itself, it erected a barrier between its own awareness and its latent inner fuel. Thus emerged religions—to suppress the unconscious—and to draw their symbols from the collective unconscious. Each religion reflects the personality of its founder and his own repressed instincts. The founder projects his narcissism upon individuals and societies, transforming them into a herd obedient to him in the name of religion.

Man fashioned his deities and stripped them of their spiritual essence, rendering them instinctive collective needs. In doing so, the god becomes a contradiction—at odds with both its own nature and the very idea of its existence. No longer the beginning and the end, it is stripped of its spiritual symbolism and becomes instead a psychological truth for every fragile soul. Individuals arm themselves with the god in opposition to the collective, while the collective arms itself with the god against history, granting itself the right to endure and unleashing its instincts upon nature.

Religion emerged from a collective instinctual will—one that imprisons the individual within its cycle, unites the group, and gathers all unconscious drives into a single collective vessel that enslaves the individual, suppressing personal instinct. Thus, individuals melt into the group, and collective instincts are elevated into a god that imposes its desires upon them.

From the very beginning, man sought power. It began as physical strength, then evolved into an abstract notion of power. To possess it, man searched for its source—but failed to identify it. Its origin lies in nature. And because man, at a subconscious level, recognised the impossibility of mastering nature, he turned instead to imagined, supernatural creative forces.

We see how early humans attempted to merge energy with religious symbols—as demonstrated in ancient stone carvings. In Africa, thousands of years ago, the Kingdom of Wakanda referred to every mysterious or intangible force as Wakanda: the sun, the moon, the stars, thunder, wind, and the demons believed to inhabit the elements. As Maj-Ji described it: “Wakanda is an expression of mystery, power, the sacred, and eternity. It is both a cosmic and practical force.”

As humanity developed, so did this concept. The Sumerians were the first to lay the foundations of cosmic order. They created gods in their own image—endowed with human emotions and traits—yet granted them the immortality that man lacked. Their gods mirrored man in their surging emotions and overwhelming impulses.

With the creation of gods, myths and legends about the beginning of the universe arose. A striking resemblance can be found between the Babylonian Enuma Elish creation epic and the Book of Genesis. In the Enuma Elish, the serpent symbolised darkness, just as it did in Genesis. The Babylonian Atrahasis epic, which recounts the birth of humanity, states that humans were fashioned from clay and blood. Likewise, in the Sumerian text Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta, we read: “In those days, there were neither serpents nor scorpions, no lions, no hyenas, no savage dogs nor wolves. There was no fear, no terror. Man had no rival, no adversary. The land of Martu was safe and secure. The entire universe, and all people, glorified Enlil with one voice.”

Just as later humans would glorify God with one tongue. We also observe the resemblance between the creation of Eve in Genesis and the creation of Ninti—the Lady of the Rib—in another Sumerian myth.

The Sumerians did not neglect to create a myth of human rebellion against the gods, as seen in the tale of Isati Shuka Kituda, where the protagonist commits a fatal sin by seducing Inanna. The epics Atrahasis and Gilgamesh both depict the wrath of the gods, who unleashed a great flood as punishment for humankind. The Sumerians also conceived myths about demons, such as Asag, the demon of plagues, to explain the disasters and diseases that befell them.

To this day, man continues to seek victory over his fear—over the thick darkness that lurks within. But in doing so, he dons the mask of a god to conceal his impotence. What he did not realise at first is that the more tightly he clings to this god, the deeper his fear grows, and the more he senses defeat echoing through the fabric of his life.
