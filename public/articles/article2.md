<h4>Who Will Win “Humanity”?</h4>

Over the past decade — ever since social media infiltrated nearly every home, bar, and street corner — we’ve seen a surge in words and phrases (regardless of their linguistic merit or expressive depth), freely offered by their creators and generously rewarded by followers and online friends with medals of “humanity.” These medals, of course, are nothing more than symbolic gestures — emojis, empty phrases, and at best, dotless, hollow expressions.

Social networks have constructed a new social order — one partly driven by collective emotional exaggeration — giving rise to grand gestures, noble declarations, and what are touted as elevated “human values.” But the foundation of these values lies in fantasy: a kind of escapist illusion that feeds an inflated “great ego.” And that ego is easily gratified — after all, such values demand no more than a few clichéd words or symbols.

We saw this flood of “humanity” in recent days with the tragic story of the Moroccan child, Rayan. No one denies the pain of the incident, especially for his family. But what invites reflection is the scale of the media coverage (I stress the word “scale” — we now live in an age of grand words, grand values, grand emotions), and the sweeping emotional response. It was, yet again, a race — a race to display the softest, most refined expressions of “humanity,” where individuals competed to earn the honorary badge of “civilisation.”

Rayan died, and all of “humanity” mourned — wiping its tears, raising its hands in prayer, drained by its collective emotional labour. The child died, and “humanity” once more slipped into a coma, briefly awakened by his cries before returning to sleep.

And so, other children might rightly wonder what this “humanity” means for them — especially those whose deaths go unnoticed, perhaps because they perish in groups rather than as individuals. Children in Syria, Yemen, Libya, Iraq — dying in droves from hunger, cold, disease — do not qualify for such coverage. They are no longer “newsworthy.” Nor are African children, some killed by tragic incidents — trampled by a hippo, or simply by poverty and lack of basic necessities. They, too, have become “old stories.”

None of these children can hope to inspire the kind of noble, global sentiment we recently witnessed. Because “humanity,” as it now functions, requires emotionally charged, individual stories. It cannot survive constant exposure to systemic suffering. To avoid emotional collapse, it must ration its sympathy.

So “humanity,” in its need for self-preservation, reveals itself in herd-like behaviour — crossing borders, fuelled by sensory globalisation. It performs empathy on demand.

And it’s not only individuals. Television networks, too, compete: who can add the most pathos to the script? Which presenter can cry more believably, perform the most heartfelt gesture? Who can win the title of Most Human? It would not be surprising to one day see a televised contest called “Who Will Win Humanity?”

This race is pushing many rational individuals — those who respond thoughtfully and without affectation to tragedy — either into silence or into mimicking the herd, out of fear they’ll be labelled “inhuman.”

Such uniform emotional reactions — disconnected from nature and blind to human diversity — ultimately pave the way for media authoritarianism. This, in turn, dulls the viewer’s ability to feel and think. I do not exaggerate when I say that one-dimensional media can manufacture emotionally impaired human templates — models of “ideal” selective compassion. We end up with a strange creature: a human being whose values and meanings are utterly confused.

This is not the first, nor will it be the last, tragic incident of its kind. Life overflows with daily personal catastrophes — and their coverage, if any, should be the responsibility of local media, nothing more.

A person who is truly conscious of life and death does not need to follow the crowd, nor become an echo, simply to prove they care. The amplified, theatrical emotions we now witness — steeped in hypocrisy and herd instinct — are no proof of anything. They reflect only a deep inability to generate change or to carve out new paths for humanity. They offer nothing more than melodrama, performed before a stone.

For years now, we’ve heard endless talk of “new” human values — limitless, borderless, all-embracing. Yet we remain caught in the same cycle of emojis, hashtags, and body language. Real values are not acrobatic displays, tearful theatrics, or reactive posturing. They are a form of sustained awareness — one that is neither fragmented nor conditioned by context.
