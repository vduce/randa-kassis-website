<h4>Religion in Its Relation to Verbal Aggression</h4>

Following the debate broadcast on France 24 — “The Burka Ban Debate in France” (08/07/2010) — I received a deluge of hostile emails laced with aggressive insults and loaded innuendos. This prompted me to devote an analytic article to the phenomenon of insults and verbal aggression, particularly as exhibited by religious individuals, in an effort to understand their apparent inability to resort to a more elevated form of language. My aim is to explore the reasons that confine them within a narrow and enclosed cognitive frame.

Let us begin by examining the type of verbal aggression saturated with sexual imagery. These insults betray repressed sexual desires in search of release. The religious individual is perpetually engaged in unconscious acts of sublimation, burying these unacknowledged desires deep within. This mechanism of self-defence and repression is further reinforced and obscured by the accumulation of negative residues within their immediate social and cultural environment.

I wish to focus briefly on the words “happiness” and “joy”, which are often misinterpreted as synonyms of “pleasure”. In many societies today, the term “pleasure” is denigrated, resented, and used interchangeably with the other two, despite important distinctions between them. These nuances are too often neglected. The believer’s naïve intellect fails to recognise that it is subject to a culture that solidifies its authority through abstract “truths” embedded in procedural or implicit memory. The interplay between short- and long-term memory unconsciously shapes our behaviour and habits, at times allowing information to surface in consciousness in a distorted form.

If we delve deeper into the psychological states hidden beneath such terms, we find that “happiness” represents the dominance of concepts acquired from one’s environment. When this is paired with the misperceptions that stem from intellectual complacency, the result is a state of joy or cheerfulness. “Pleasure”, however, complements these states. Sexual intercourse, in this context, acts as a channel to process the energy arising from these emotional states and affects — which, as we know, are located in and closely linked to the sexual organs.

Returning to insults steeped in sexual imagery, we find they are nothing more than projections of the religious person’s internal fantasies and frustrations — a psychological outlet for the inner images produced by various mechanisms of repression and often entangled with one another. Thus, the religious person hurls insults referencing sexual positions or group sex; at times, they unconsciously reveal more primitive desires, such as intercourse with the mother, which they project onto the Other — the different. In truth, they are expressing transgressive fantasies, forbidden desires, and perhaps even deeply buried ancestral memories encoded in our genetic structure.

This psychological condition is frequently found in individuals raised in repressive societies that hold them in a state of perpetual subjugation. By contrast, an individual who is aware of their biological specificities and external environment defines, in a conscious and responsible manner, a set of principles, values, and ethics that honour every living being, and strives to uphold these standards in interactions with all creatures — human and non-human alike.

The problem with those who are mentally programmed, operating in a mechanical manner, and cut off from basic civic values is that they cannot reconcile with themselves, let alone others. They exist in a constant state of denial about their instinctual drives and display overt intolerance towards the Other. Their cultural environment has annulled desire and reduced sexuality to a mechanical reproductive function.

This disjunction between instinctual drives and biological needs on one side, and external cultural constructs on the other, leads to schizophrenic behaviour and a range of other psychological disturbances, including deep-seated anxiety.

Neurobiologist Henri Laborit explains that language is the primary mechanism by which domination is established, as it assumes an institutional form tied to the group rather than the individual. In this framework, sexual satisfaction is sublimated and replaced by the gratification derived from domination. It is thus unsurprising that individuals living in taboo-ridden societies relinquish much of their sexual rights in favour of, first, individual, and then collective domination. Ironically, these same oppressed individuals become staunch defenders of the moral codes that suppress their own instinctual needs. All of this functions within the same structure of ego-based domination, where the ego serves the collective interest at the expense of the individual — who is, in return, compensated with trivial and simplistic satisfactions.

Let us return to repressed biological satisfaction — namely, sex — and its relation to anxiety and hostile (verbal) behaviour.

Each individual’s sensory activity seeks structural satisfaction, also known as biological balance, which involves the pursuit of happiness, joy, and pleasure simultaneously. However, when these biological drives encounter external laws rooted in domination, anxiety ensues. This anxiety emerges from the realisation that pleasure, and hence instinctual fulfilment, is unattainable. In an attempt to escape this condition, the individual becomes hostile and aggressive towards any stimulus that threatens to expose or awaken those repressed instincts. Aggressive behaviour thus becomes a mechanism for mitigating the psychological anxiety triggered by internal conflict and neurological tension distributed across various levels of the biological system. A repressed individual struggles even to recognise, let alone fulfil, these latent and inhibited drives.

It is in this light that one can understand the tendency of religious individuals to resort — often unconsciously — to verbal aggression laced with sexual imagery. This is perhaps the most commonplace and least severe form of aggression they exhibit. Such language serves as an outlet for their repressed sexual energy and unfulfilled fantasies. What we are dealing with here are clearly neurotic subjects.

We must also acknowledge the inner struggle between acquired values and instinctual drives, the latter being inscribed in our procedural memory. Acts of sublimation only widen the divide between consciousness and the unconscious, resulting in a split between implicit and explicit memory.

For this reason, it seems vital to return to the principle of pleasure — not to indulge it uncritically, but to reconcile it with the values we inherit from our surroundings, thereby shaping new ethical paradigms. These must acknowledge our instincts, respect the integrity of the individual, and harmonise, rather than clash, with collective interest.
