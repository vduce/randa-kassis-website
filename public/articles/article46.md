<h4>The Deification of the Superego</h4>

For much of human history, people lived in a state of unconsciousness, driven by primal urges and the instinctive pursuit of their satisfaction. Yet the need for safety—and protection from predatory creatures—compelled humans to seek refuge in the collective. Thus began a long journey towards individual consciousness.

This awareness did not emerge in isolation, but was shaped by the surrounding culture, which gradually established itself as a force designed to restrain unconscious impulses and regulate human behaviour in the interest of communal welfare. Culture initially took form through customs and traditions—patterns of individual conduct that had been filtered, refined, and preserved by the collective across generations.

One of the earliest domains culture sought to control was sexuality. What began as an effort to confine sexual behaviour within the boundaries of family later evolved into prohibitions, first through mythology, then institutionalised by religion.

As communities matured, they assumed responsibility for restricting individual freedom by codifying behaviour through unwritten laws. The notion of justice and punishment arose from these cultural norms, aiming to subdue the innate tendencies towards violence and hostility present in human nature. Yet the rebellious spirit persisted within the individual, prompting society to sanctify its rules by linking them to divine authority—a force stronger than tradition itself. In this way, the suppression of instinct was no longer merely cultural, but spiritual.

Divine punishment, then, drew its power from deep within the psyche. The individual found themselves locked in an internal conflict: between the ego, which seeks to fulfil instinctual desires, and the superego, the internalised judge representing societal values and prohibitions. This conflict produced a profound sense of guilt—born from the pressure exerted by the superego upon the ego—which in turn led to a subconscious form of self-punishment, projected outwardly as divine retribution.

Unaware of the psychological origins of this struggle, the individual interpreted it through myth: as punishment from a Creator angered by human disobedience. In this way, the divine acquired a moral and spiritual dimension, becoming a projection of the superego, and embedding itself further within the framework of culture.

Culture, then, is a set of values, customs, and prohibitions recognised by a given community. It operates as an external force capable of restraining violent impulses and shaping human behaviour. Though cultures differ and evolve over time, their ultimate goal remains the same: the advancement of human thought through peaceful coexistence, equality among peoples, and a sense of compassion for all living beings.

To reach that ideal, culture initially adopted a repressive guise, embedding its principles first in conscious thought, then—through repetition and social pressure—into the unconscious, where they became integral to the human psyche. Once these values took root, culture could begin to ease its grip, allowing for greater individual freedom within the collective.

However, in some societies, this transformation stalled. In the Middle East, for instance, culture became inseparably fused with divinity. Feelings of guilt towards the divine became deeply entrenched, beginning with the myth of the original sin—Adam and Eve’s transgression—designed to bind the entire community under the authority of religion.

Over time, individual attempts at rebellion emerged, often in the form of prophets who sought to liberate humanity from this inherited guilt. Yet despite their intentions, these figures often fell into the very trap they sought to dismantle. Rather than dissolve the burden of guilt, they inadvertently reinforced it, as their messages were absorbed and redirected by the collective superego, which subsumed their movements into the dominant moral structure.

The collective superego thus managed to co-opt these efforts, creating internal contradictions within the prophets themselves—between their original aim of liberation and the eventual outcome of their missions. These revolts were not purely personal initiatives, but rather expressions of an unconscious collective yearning to break free from cultural and institutional authority.

Christ, for instance, challenged the religious establishment of his time, just as Socrates defied the prevailing norms of Athenian society. Both faced death for their ideas. But while Socrates contributed to the emergence of secular, rational thought in Europe—detaching culture from divine origin—Christ’s message deepened the association between morality and divine judgment, reinforcing the structure of guilt. Yet in both cases, the outcome was the same: the system resisted and extinguished their challenge.

Thus, those who rebelled against the dominant cultural order were, in a sense, responding to a latent collective desire for transformation—though they may have misunderstood the full implications of their mission.

This leads us to a pressing question:
Why has the Middle East, more than any other region, produced so many prophets and divine figures?

Was it because the cultures of this region were particularly repressive, expressing unconscious human drives more intensely?

Or was it that the strong individual egos of these prophets drove them to bind culture to the divine, and thereby to themselves?

What is certain is that the conflation of culture and divinity became deeply embedded in the collective unconscious of the region’s inhabitants. As a result, the existence of both individual and community became inextricably linked to the existence of God. And with this came a profound obstacle: any individual attempt to break free from this collective destiny is met not with curiosity, but with rejection—and often, erasure.

I can only conclude with Nietzsche’s words: 'Man cannot rise high if he remains ignorant of his destiny'.
