<h4>In the Swoon of Arab Societies</h4>

Arab societies appear as immovable and unchanging entities—resistant to transformation, retreating into isolation, intolerant of the 'other', and unwilling to engage with difference. This results in a persistent tendency to draw nationalist distinctions, a division between 'us' and 'them'. Ironically, many Arab societies apply this same logic of exclusion and discrimination internally, turning it against their own people.

These societies are, in effect, in a coma. Their capacity for production and motion is paralysed—stifled by the repeated traumas of historical defeat over the past centuries. The collapse of certain political ideologies has only deepened this paralysis, giving rise instead to a form of religious and moral hysteria. Efforts to adapt to a new world order are being carried out with the same comatose mindset. One could say these societies are in a pre-conscious state, akin to a child attempting to outgrow infancy. It is at this very moment that old narratives of past glories and humiliations resurface and reassert themselves in the collective psyche. Rather than confronting the disappointments of history, these societies attempt to conceal them beneath the carpet of the unconscious.

To the outside world, they present a proud façade—a claim to moral and spiritual superiority. They convince themselves that they are a chosen people, destined for some long-lost glory. Their cultural identity is rooted in a sense of superiority and excessive pride in belonging, which has only deepened their isolation. While they frequently accuse others of racism, they seldom pause to examine their own prejudices or the intense animosity they harbour towards those who differ from them.

From a psychological perspective, and as a result of their successive defeats, many Arab societies remain gripped by a deep-seated inferiority complex—one that has been transfigured into a fantasy of lost victories. They remain perpetually defensive, ever ready to attack those who think or live differently. Cloaked in fear, they wage symbolic wars against others’ beliefs. Yet in their obsessive belligerence, they lose sight of their true aim: the elevation of the individual and the advancement of society towards a more humane and enlightened state.

This climate of fear leads to repression and the destruction of the individual. The same historical tragedies are endlessly repeated, buried deep within the collective memory, only to resurface again. These societies resemble a naïve soldier with a narrow field of vision—lacking the tools for constructive adaptation in a rapidly changing world. They lack a clear strategic vision, a coherent definition of priorities. As a result, they are consumed by confusion and inertia, which pushes them further into isolation. And the more isolated they become, the more reactive and uninformed their responses grow.

In such a context, the only remaining source of pride becomes religion. Societies begin reconstructing their laws and institutions around religious discourse, retreating into older ways of life and modes of thinking that are fundamentally out of step with the profound transformations shaping the modern world. This withdrawal is a key factor in the gradual disintegration of the social fabric. It leads to a kind of cultural and intellectual rot. The social body turns in on itself, enclosed within a narrow sphere, refusing to acknowledge any movement or innovation beyond its borders.

These societies now find themselves waging a war on two fronts: internally, to suppress any individual attempts at rebellion or reform; and externally, to assert their identity and beliefs in the face of other nations. But their narrow, pessimistic worldview deprives them of the internal peace and stability they might otherwise enjoy. They become caught in a cycle of self-inflicted oppression.

Though our societies have suffered repeated tragedies and calamities, they have failed to acquire the knowledge necessary to confront present-day challenges. The emergence of religions in the region—often romanticised under the misleading term “the Middle East”—did not help foster a culture of critical thought. Nor have the historical experiences of suffering and oppression taught any meaningful lessons. The absolute reliance on religion stems from an inability to analyse and interpret the world rationally. These societies entangle their misery and suffering with religious faith, turning ever more desperately towards a God who dominates their worldview and daily life. This, in turn, leads to the erosion of the individual self, with profound negative effects on collective behaviour.

The dynamic between the individual and the group becomes especially destructive. The group absorbs and overrides individual belief, while the individual is expected to renounce their uniqueness for the sake of collective conformity. Individual value is sacrificed at the altar of group identity. Individuals become willing to martyr themselves for the group’s ideals. In societies where laws and values are drawn from religion, religion itself becomes the ultimate objective—something to which every individual must aspire. With the collapse of Arab nationalism, many turned to religion to reconstruct their local identities. The resulting rise of fundamentalist and extremist movements—preaching jihad in the name of God—is a logical consequence of this failure.
