<h4>Samurai Wisdom and the Islamist Threat</h4>

Now that the Tunisian anti-power virus has begun to take effect, it must swiftly seek vaccines to counter smaller, emerging viruses disguised in religious thought. In doing so, this nascent new consciousness may discover a viable path towards life.

There is little doubt that Tunisian society possesses a robust immune system capable of resisting the trap of religious delirium. This immunity and predisposition may stem from various factors, foremost among them a fifty-year foundation built on a system relatively close to Western secularism. Let us not forget that Tunisian women have, for a long time, enjoyed civil rights and liberties still denied to their counterparts in virtually all other Arab nations. This fact alone has fortified the country’s resistance to the religious infectious fungus. Moreover, Tunisia’s geographical proximity to Europe, the sizeable Tunisian diaspora on the continent, the cultural exchanges born out of historical and personal encounters, and—last but not least—the mutual economic interests it shares with France have all made Tunisia an inhospitable ground for the infiltration of fundamentalist religious thought. Tunisians are far less exposed than many of their Arab neighbours to the risk of falling under autocratic rule rooted in the sharia of conquest and subjugation.

Tunisia’s battle is not yet over. The struggle for life—and the struggle of life—continues. Yet, it has already succeeded in exporting its triumph over the invisible frontiers of fear to other Arab states. The Tunisian domino has toppled into Egypt, despite the significant differences between the two, not least Egypt’s vulnerability to organised Islamic thought, deeply entrenched within its social fabric and openly seeking to extend its influence and seize political power. Despite these setbacks, we must support revolutionary movements regardless of their ultimate outcomes—and prepare ourselves for any potential assault from the religious virus.

Before we ask what might come next, or contemplate the unknown destinies of angry crowds, we must turn our attention to more immediate and visible threats. These revolts are unfolding within a climate of heightened religious sentiment. Islamic movements will not hesitate to seize upon the opportunity to ride the wave of popular protest. In that regard, they are no different from leeches feeding on the blood of the people. They are no different from the tyrants of the region. They will exchange guarantees of safety and dignity for ethereal promises, with no earthly assets, only threats of punishment in the hereafter for anyone who dares reclaim their lost self.

Perhaps the time has come for diverse forces—regardless of creed or conviction—to unite under a shared desire and vision for an earthly future. Perhaps now is the time to draw up a carefully considered strategy to confront and contain religious thought, without hesitation or compromise.

It does not matter whether we share identical visions or solutions. What matters is the ultimate aim that unites all of humanity. As the Buddhists put it, “We may take different roads to reach the mountain top, but once we arrive, we see all paths from the same vantage.”

This is why I believe our foremost concern must be the construction of a new social and economic programme—one that places the interests of individuals above all else, and then considers the collective good beyond religious or ethnic allegiances. Such a programme may prove to be the best safeguard against the rigid Islamic cancer fuelled by Saudi oil money.

There is no denying that many factors have allowed this deeply entrenched cancer to take root in the minds of wretched, hungry peoples who have long suffered from war, colonisation and oppression—and who now face a gaping intellectual void that religion fills with saccharine dreams and promises.

Equally undeniable is the organisational prowess of Islamist groups. They are skilled in recruitment and in exploiting the psychological wounds of these long-oppressed societies to advance their own agendas—and those of their religious leaders, who are the primary beneficiaries of such social structures. Naturally, these organisations flourish under the shadow of authoritarian and corrupt states that have robbed their people of every liberty and left them only with ruins and economic collapse. The combination of all these conditions has rendered the region a fertile ground for the cultivation of religious poison. It is all too easy for these organisations to cloak themselves in the garb of purity, virtue and righteousness—deceiving nations with hollow promises of a brighter tomorrow. They rekindle illusions of a bygone Islamic golden age, an era of bounty, affluence and bliss. Dreamers are promised an empty triumph over all adversity.

These religious-political movements possess a masterful understanding of how to strike the right psychological chord. They know precisely how to stir individuals and exploit the immense yearning for psychological redemption—after centuries of historical defeat.

I believe it is imperative to expose how history is being twisted and misrepresented. We must shine a light on the true causes of this much-lauded “Islamic awakening”, which was not born of the cultural heritage of the Arabian Peninsula. The achievements attributed to the Umayyads and Abbasids were in fact the result of centuries of diverse civilisational amalgamation across the Middle East and beyond—including Egypt—long before the rise of Islam. This so-called awakening was therefore not a product of Islam alone, but a result of rich cultural intermixing. As we know, religion is a cultural product—it cannot transcend the norms and values of the environment that births it.

Fundamentalist Islamist thought has succeeded in recruiting a core of marginalised individuals and reviving the memory of jihad in the minds of the vulnerable—forming a chorus of suicidal souls, eager to kill and be killed. While suicide may remain an individual act, a ‘choice’, claiming the right to kill is unequivocally a crime against humanity.

To counter this notion, we must make peace with the idea of death—when life is rendered unbearable. In the shadows of cruelty and deprivation, we must revisit the ancient wisdom of the Japanese samurai, who, when faced with crisis and forced to weigh life against death, would choose death with clarity and courage.

Once we conquer the fear of death, we can face all obstacles to life with greater resolve. We must adopt flexible strategies, adaptable to ever-shifting contexts and realities.

I strongly believe in a strategy built upon organisation, willpower, dexterity, and an astute choice of discourse that speaks to the psyche of our societies with intellectual suppleness and a readiness to act beyond the confines of ego. These are the most effective tactics to rein in the Islamists.

Let me close with the words of the Chinese military strategist Sun Tzu:

“Victory and defeat are not the result of pure chance, nor of divine intervention. They are the outcome of choice—the choice of one strategy over another. Sound strategic foundations can only lead to victory.”
