<h4>The Influence of Chinese Philosophy on Eighteenth-Century Europe</h4>

There is little doubt that societies pass through various phases and undergo profound upheavals that lead to pivotal shifts in their structure. These transformations result in the emergence of new characteristics that help societies expand and progress. Such transitional periods are often accompanied by significant obstacles, frequently posed by religious groups entrenched in positions of power or closely allied with authoritarian regimes.

While the conditions that enable transformation differ from one society to another—each shaped by its own ideological, economic, and social realities—examining the experiences of certain countries and communities, and studying the factors and motivations behind the success of their transitional processes, can provide valuable insight and inspiration.

Let us, for instance, consider the European experience in the eighteenth century and examine the forces that enabled it to liberate itself from the grip of theologians. At the time, Europe was grappling with the oppression of minority sects and the pervasive control of the Church over science and media. Clerics refused to tolerate any individual or group that dared to question religious laws or doctrines. This authoritarian spirit was encapsulated by Samuel Johnson, who declared: “False teaching ought to be suppressed as soon as it appears, and civil authority should ally with the Church in punishing anyone who dares attack the established religion.”

What ultimately helped shift the balance was Europe’s exposure to other civilisations, notably that of China, which was then flourishing in a golden age. The curiosity of European authorities led them to explore Chinese civilisation in depth and gather extensive information about it. France and England, in particular, dispatched exploratory missions comprising Jesuits, scholars, and travellers.

This cultural and philosophical encounter with China played a pivotal role in undermining religious dogmas within Europe. Western thinkers discovered an ethical system that functioned independently of divine revelation, arousing the curiosity of many philosophers who began to study Confucianism and Taoism. These traditions impressed them by their lack of doctrinal dogma. Confucius, in particular, was admired for having established a moral and social philosophy grounded in ethics rather than fear of divine punishment. He formulated a vision of good and evil based on human values, not metaphysical threats.

Confucius succeeded in replacing many terms derived from primitive religious vocabulary with purely ethical ones, creating a comprehensive moral code for social conduct. His philosophy focused on human beings and their service to one another, aspiring to elevate them towards the ideal of the “superior man”. This intellectual shift played a significant role in loosening the hold of theological authority in Europe. Some philosophers were so taken by Confucius that the German thinker Christian Wolff suggested he be counted among the saints, stating thatConfucius had “taught the people the principles of virtue five hundred years before the advent of Christianity.”

Chinese civilisation’s impact also extended to European literature and theatre. Chinese-themed plays appeared on the English stage, and Voltaire adapted a Chinese drama into his play The Chinese Orphan. In his Philosophical Dictionary, he described China as “the most admirable of kingdoms—ancient, vast, populous, and the best governed.”

While this influence was evident in the realms of philosophy and literature, it was equally notable in the scientific sphere. Academic institutions played a complementary role in advancing thought, particularly with philosophers attaining strategic positions—such as Duclos—which allowed them to influence academic curricula. Meanwhile, the emergence of salons and cafés as venues for debate marked the beginning of a cultural renaissance, nurturing the exchange of ideas and fostering intellectual growth.

These developments significantly contributed to the rise of the press and the publication of scientific and literary journals, making knowledge accessible to the middle classes, not only the elite. This democratisation of knowledge helped distance the public from superstition and religious mysticism.

The growth of science became the principal driver of intellectual awakening and the demystification of the natural world. With the advent of machinery, societies began shifting from agrarian to industrial economies, giving rise to new ideologies, such as the emergence of liberalism in England and France. Political parties began to form, including the Catholic Social Party in the early nineteenth century, which focused on workers’ welfare and introduced initiatives such as savings funds and schools.

This growing interest in workers’ rights laid the foundation for early socialist thought, championed by intellectuals from bourgeois and noble backgrounds. These thinkers rebelled against the capitalist exploitation of the labouring masses and called upon the working class to assume power.

Ultimately, the bourgeoisie played a crucial role as the driving force behind qualitative social and political transformation. Likewise, certain members of the nobility contributed to revolutionary and philosophical thought throughout the ages. However, if we examine the current state of the Arab bourgeoisie, we observe a starkly different reality. Rather than driving progress, it tends to exhibit intellectual stagnation, directing its limited capacities towards the accumulation of wealth through dubious means—leaving little positive impact on the societies to which it belongs.
