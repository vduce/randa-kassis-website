<h4>The Sex–Death Syndrome</h4>

Over the years, many psychologists and anthropologists have delved into ancient belief systems, and some have concluded that understanding the human sexual instinct is key to deciphering the myths that gave rise to spirituality and religion. According to this view, the genital region lies at the symbolic heart of many early beliefs.

Geza Roheim posited that sexuality is the unconscious foundation of spirituality—a concentrated essence of the soul. In his interpretation of various myths, he identified a recurring link between semen and the soul. The phallus, in a state of erection or during intercourse, appears to be threatened with detachment from the body—a metaphorical threat of castration. This latent belief, deeply embedded in the unconscious, compelled many researchers to explore tribal myths in search of its origins.

Roheim, for instance, found that in certain societies such as the Māori, sexual climax was viewed as the soul’s dissipation—particularly in the act of ejaculation, where semen, seen as life itself, was expelled from the body. The female genitalia, on the other hand, came to symbolise death. This notion surfaces in the myth of Māui and Hine-nui-te-pō, in which Māui dies upon uniting with the goddess—his death signifying the fatal nature of sexual union. To preserve the soul and avert such danger, these societies developed magical rituals and chants intended to shield the phallus from symbolic death during intercourse.

This brings us to the symbolic role of the earth in such mythologies. Across numerous cultures and languages, the earth is portrayed as feminine and is closely tied to the concept of death. In one legend, the earth tells Rangi: 'I shall reclaim you all in death'. The earth, in this sense, represents bodily dissolution—the inevitable return to dust. Ancient cultures often associated the sky with masculinity, as in Greek mythology, where Uranus (the sky) envelops Gaia (the earth goddess). A similar duality appears in Chinese cosmology through the yin and yang.

The beliefs of the Karen people further illustrate this symbolic landscape. According to their mythology, the path to paradise is a spear-shaped bridge between earth and sky, which only a select few men can cross. Those who fail fall back to earth and are transformed into women. In this worldview, women are seen as fallen men—punished through symbolic castration and deprived of the phallus.

The primitive male’s fear of losing semen, compounded by his ignorance of reproduction and the female’s role in receiving his seed, gave rise to numerous myths equating ejaculation with death. This may explain the prohibition of sexual intercourse during wartime in some tribes, as it was seen as a harbinger of defeat. In certain Native American tribes, magical practices aimed to retrieve lost semen, reflecting the belief that the male’s spirit resided in it. And since ejaculation implied the woman’s reception of it, the female body—particularly her genitalia—became a locus of death. Hence, in many myths and religious systems, woman is burdened with the symbolic role of evil and suffering.

The fear of castration reappears in many myths, such as that of Osiris and Set, or in primordial tales of sons clashing with their fathers over women. In one version, Osiris castrates his father—a symbolic reenactment of the murder of the 'primal father'. Freud, in his interpretation of totemic systems, saw the totem as a displaced father figure whose stature was gradually elevated until it became sacred. The original crime gave rise to a collective guilt, one that reverberates across cultures, myths, and religions.

Death has always haunted the human imagination. Most ancient myths revolve around life after death, or the idea of death as a new birth. The practice of mummification itself seems to have emerged from a belief in another life beyond this one—a promise of eternal happiness to those who believed. This idea reappears across religious systems that promote the notion of everlasting bliss. Yet early humans, unable to reconcile earthly joy with eternal joy—because of conflicting unconscious drives—failed to imagine both simultaneously. Life, being short and uncertain, became something to be compensated for in a mythical afterlife: a realm of perfect, disembodied happiness, untethered from earth and reason.

Looking deeper into early legal and social structures, we find that the totemic belief in living spirits behind natural phenomena was, in essence, an attempt to preserve life. The exchange of souls between humans and their totems—as interpreted by Frazer—and the transmission of vital energy among living beings, contributed to humanity’s invention of the eternal.

At the heart of this existential struggle lies the tension between human beings and their doubles—a tension rooted in instinctual desires, especially the need for sexual satisfaction. When these desires go unmet, they can erupt into violence against the other. Freud’s theory of sublimation holds that sexual impulses can be redirected toward social and cultural values, serving the collective good. Still, we must not overlook the fact that sexuality has played a foundational role in shaping the myths and religions that have defined human existence.
