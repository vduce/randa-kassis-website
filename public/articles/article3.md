<h4>The Parrot Syndrome</h4>

Many mistakenly believe that tyranny is confined to autocratic rulers. In truth, it often conceals itself beneath the guise of reform and piety, preying on a population’s yearning for change. From Renaissance Florence to the modern Middle East, the syndrome recurs — the faces change, but the structures of deception remain eerily familiar.

In the late fifteenth century, Girolamo Savonarola captivated a significant portion of Florence’s population with his fervent sermons and alignment with the poor and disenfranchised. Promising a people’s republic, he presented himself as a righteous preacher, condemning Rome and the Pope — whom he saw as the very embodiment of corruption.

Savonarola’s rejection of art, poetry, and philosophy — which he deemed distractions from divine devotion — resonated with many, not only among the masses, but also among the opponents of Lorenzo the Magnificent, the famed patron of the arts under whose reign Florence flourished artistically, commercially, and architecturally.

Two years after Lorenzo’s death, and following the flight of his son Piero during the French invasion of 1494, Savonarola managed to negotiate with King Charles VIII of France, securing the right for Florentines to choose their own government — a right previously reserved for a select elite.

Though this shift appeared democratic on the surface, in reality it ushered in a theocratic rule under Savonarola’s iron grip. His reign, known as the “years of darkness”, saw the burning of books, the destruction of Botticelli’s paintings, and even the smashing of Michelangelo’s sculptures.

It is difficult not to draw parallels between Savonarola’s Florence — seduced by the illusion of democracy — and our own societies, which embraced revolutionary slogans without questioning the cultural foundations upon which real change must be built.

In more recent times, particularly following the uprisings across parts of the Middle East and North Africa, we witnessed a surge in political dissidents and human rights activists. Yet their conception of rights remained conditional, filtered through the lens of their own inherited cultural values.

They called for political freedom without first understanding its essence, or freeing it from the cultural strictures that constrain individual autonomy. In this, they differed little from the rulers they opposed — figures who, despite their lack of vision or competence, clung to power not through merit, but through inertia and the absence of alternatives.

Many of these rulers evoke the image of medieval monarchs. Take, for instance, Louis XI of France, who imprisoned his adversaries in narrow cages — a precursor to modern methods of repression, perfected by successors who crammed hundreds into cells scarcely four square metres in size.

Nor is Charles VI — the so-called “mad king” — so far removed; the traits are disturbingly familiar.

As for today’s activists and self-styled defenders of liberty and democracy, one finds more than a faint echo of Savonarola’s moral absolutism. The difference lies only in their diminished eloquence and inability to rally the masses.

The so-called Arab Spring allowed many to purge their long-repressed frustrations, and transformed some into vocal opponents of authoritarianism. But their slogans, however legitimate in content, were devoid of cultural introspection.

We cannot democratise governance without first anchoring the rights of the individual — the right to express oneself freely and to live authentically, unburdened by traditional formulas such as “customs”, “tradition”, or “the forbidden”.

This is why so many activists and opposition figures, for over a decade now, continue to recite the same mantras about democracy and human rights, without ever working to chart a path towards them.

Subconsciously, they parrot these phrases not out of principle, but to mask their intellectual impotence — their inability to conceive of genuine frameworks for change.

It is this confusion — this lack of conceptual clarity — that leads to what I call the Parrot Syndrome.

In functioning democracies, activist movements are often capable of generating public debate, pressuring political actors to engage with emerging demands. Whether related to the environment, animal welfare, or individual freedoms, such movements are often the very expression of ongoing cultural and social transformation.

But such shifts cannot occur without first emancipating the imagination — liberating the individual from inherited taboos and disabling fixations that suffocate human potential.

We must also distinguish between the role of the activist and that of the politician or political dissident.

The activist’s role is to spotlight barriers to transformation, to awaken collective consciousness, and to galvanise groups into action — so that change becomes a political necessity embraced by parties or institutions.

Sadly, this distinction is rarely observed in our region. Both activists and dissidents tend to repeat the same empty slogans, mechanically and uncritically — parroting them with no real strategy for change.

Worse still, some Western governments encourage this sterile performance, failing to distinguish between those with genuine capability and those who merely imitate.

Yet we are not bound by this dilemma, nor by these two dismal archetypes.

We possess many pathways — and many tools — for real, substantive change: the kind that leads to the democratisation of meaning, of culture, and of society at large.

But this can only be achieved by conscious individuals.

History is not solely the domain of institutions — it is written by those who dare to break the cycle of repetition… and liberate themselves from the Parrot Syndrome.
