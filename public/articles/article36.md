The quest for something lost and found after many years has long stirred my imagination. It has been a major driving force throughout my life. I was seeking a kind of freedom—one that allows the self to inhabit every being and become one with Mother Nature, much like a child who, without understanding why, longs to return to the sanctuary of the womb.

Perhaps we suffer from a tragic severance between the Self and the Great Nurturer, and we are perpetually striving to comprehend the reason, the wisdom, behind this rupture. It mirrors the trauma of birth—the moment the child is torn from the mother’s body—leaving behind an anxiety that lurks in the unconscious, never fully extinguished.

This is precisely why we must free ourselves from the immutable principles instilled in us in our countries of origin. Human beings are in a state of constant evolution, as are the principles and beliefs we construct for ourselves. Sometimes, we feel compelled to choose life in a country that has—at least to a certain extent—surpassed our own in seeking a balance between individual liberty and collective interest. Such societies have endured centuries of painful struggle to better understand human history and motivation, and to forge a more advanced, more coherent intellectual path.

Here begins the journey of the mind, searching for a guiding thread toward a liberated spirit. This yearning to connect with every living creature is an attempt to align ourselves with the natural order. We must traverse many stages to approach freedom—true freedom—which may only be attainable if every atom of our bodies dissolves once more into the greater natural whole from which we first emerged.

Amid these reflections, the rigid concepts and narrow doctrines of the past are blurred by the seductive effect of the very words we were raised on. Yet there is always a new mode of thinking—one that opens different perspectives, breaks long-held taboos, and shatters the barriers that obstruct human progress. We must ask ourselves: what is the purpose of life, and to what end do we live it? After much painful contemplation, we may come to see that existence is not about clinging to fixed beliefs, but about swaying and dancing gracefully to life’s ever-shifting rhythm.

Never for a moment did I imagine that Europe was a paradise on earth, nor have I ever claimed that Western societies have attained a definitive grasp of noble human ideals. But for individuals in search of depth and clarity of the self, there is an inherent urge to express thoughts and truths in a direct, unflinching manner.

Many of us have repeatedly experienced moments of bitter disappointment, not least due to the blatant hypocrisy and double standards openly expressed in the West, in stark contrast to universal human values. Nevertheless, despite my strong disagreements with how certain issues are addressed, I cannot in good faith dismiss the substantial achievements of Western societies. I feel some contentment regarding the direction my intellectual journey has taken and the small steps I have made in pursuit of free thought. Let us not forget that a society which allows space for expression and critical thought on any matter is, in truth, a society that values its people and sees them as equal before the law.

Of course, such a society must define red lines—boundaries within which individuals can exercise their freedom. Some might question these boundaries, viewing them as a pretext for excluding other cultures. It may appear, at times, that this freedom is granted only to those whose minds and hearts are sufficiently Westernised—that Western culture, like any other, can become a prosecuting machine that casts out all others. Here, I must clarify: humanity must not regress. What the advanced nations of the world uphold today is the product of centuries of struggle. I believe Western cultures have every right to defend their intellectual foundations and to resist any movement seeking to suppress thought, inhibit reason, or return us to archaic dogmas and fables that have claimed too many lives. The point I am making here is not born of infatuation with the West, but of love for free thought and for freedom itself—my aim, and the hope of all humanity.

Western influence is not rooted in hypnotic manipulation; it stems from the values it professes—an appeal to our human desire to accomplish something meaningful within an organised social framework. We are all summoned to realise freedom in its most encompassing sense, in a manner that includes all living beings. Only then can we say that the West’s achievements are not exclusive to the West, nor is its culture self-generated. Western civilisation, as we encounter it today, is the cumulative product of a vast historical and intellectual exchange, constantly moving from one region to another. Its accomplishments have emerged from the finest contributions of many civilisations across the globe, since the dawn of human history and the origins of life on this planet.

Our varied human experiences have taught us that the turning points in history are shaped by a commitment to free and unconstrained thought—thought that embraces both construction and deconstruction, reform and renewal. The legacy of these experiences lives on in France and across the West. Yet it is vital to remember that Western societies are far from perfect; they remain unfinished, still weaving their fabric. That is why they still stand to benefit from the richness brought by individuals of diverse backgrounds and cultures—individuals who carry their own finely woven threads.

I hold both criticism and admiration for Western societies, and for France in particular. It was here that I learned to breathe in polluted air and exhale something cleaner—air that opens the heart and clears the mind. But I must also address a malignant problem now afflicting both the West and humanity as a whole. This problem spreads like a virus, and many avoid speaking of it openly, constrained by rigid laws surrounding political correctness and racism—laws which often silence reasoned voices and thoughtful critique. Paradoxically, racism and supremacist attitudes are on the rise, having found fertile ground in a dangerous and insidious form of chauvinism, which I believe is the worst manifestation of racism.

When we examine chauvinism closely, we see racism as a developed expression of ethnic egocentrism. In using the word “developed,” I do not mean progressed, for development is not always synonymous with progress. Primitive forms of ethnic identity have evolved from the same root of xenophobia—an instinctual hatred of the foreign. This tendency emerged alongside the formation of social groups, and can be observed among other social creatures as well. In returning to racism, we witness humanity’s regression into an animalistic state. Our accumulated knowledge and philosophical insights have yet to fully tame this primitive impulse, which persists as societies grow and organise themselves.

It is true that all peoples and cultures grapple with some aspect of this ancestral inheritance. Humanity is universal, but what sets us apart is our capacity for free thought. What distinguishes one society from another is the extent to which it enshrines civil liberties and human rights in concrete laws that protect individuals—regardless of how radically their thoughts may differ from the prevailing social norms.

In my view, the Western populace has failed to live up to the universal values it claims to defend. Chauvinism remains a potent weapon wielded by philistines—those who boast of nothing but their nationality, their legislation, and their intellectual forebears. Today, more than ever, we need an intellectual awakening to restrain Western governments from stoking chauvinism within their native populations through a media that is increasingly tabloid-driven and feudal in tone. Complacency and pride are among the greatest enemies of human progress—and this applies equally, if not more so, to the Western variety.
