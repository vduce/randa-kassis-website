<h4>In Syria: Revolt and Secularity</h4>


10 June 2015


The recent wave of protests across several Arab countries raised significant hopes among women. These mass movements were, at the time, seen as the dawn of a new awareness, with the ultimate aim of achieving change. This period was preceded by a surge in secular and anti-religious movements, particularly in the virtual sphere, expressing a clear desire for substantial reforms. The goal of these secularists was to establish a democracy rooted in individual rights, allowing people at last to speak freely. Women were deeply involved in these secular movements, both prior to and during the emergence of the Arab Spring. Naturally, they hoped to lay the groundwork for gender equality and to bring an end to all forms of discrimination.

Contrary to these aspirations, the Arab Spring gave rise to radical Islamism, grounded in a literal interpretation of certain violent verses from the Qur’an-verses that reflect a deep-seated contempt for women, manifesting in misogynistic attitudes and discriminatory jurisprudence. While this “Spring” succeeded in toppling a few Arab dictators, it has, in many cases, replaced authoritarianism with a new form of tyranny: religious despotism. With the return of theocratic governance, women were among the first to suffer. Indeed, their situation has worsened in several Arab Spring countries, despite their active role in opposing authoritarian regimes and challenging social taboos.

Paradoxically, women’s rights have regressed following the uprisings in the MENA region (Middle East and North Africa). In many of these countries, women have become primary targets of violence-be it physical, social, or economic. Nonetheless, the outcomes vary widely depending on the circumstances and diversity of each nation.

Take Syria, for instance: women’s status varies significantly depending on their social, religious, or ethnic background. Syrian society is highly heterogeneous, and Common Law differs from one community to another. Four distinct personal status codes exist, pertaining to Catholic, Orthodox, Druze, and Sunni communities. For Sunnis, the code is based on Islamic Sharia. Although the Syrian Constitution proclaims secularity and freedom of worship, it also stipulates in Article 3 that the President of the Republic must be Muslim. Moreover, while the Constitution affirms gender equality in the workplace-promoting women’s financial independence-it still contains discriminatory provisions, including penal codes that legally justify so-called “honour crimes”.

Since the uprising of 2011, many women have fallen victim to rape-by both regime forces and rebel factions. The situation has further deteriorated, particularly in areas under Islamist rebel control. In territories held by the Islamic State, women accused of adultery have been stoned to death, and many are now confined to their homes by fear and force.

It is important to emphasise that other Islamist rebel groups also promote a rigid and restrictive interpretation of Islam, pushing to impose backward ideologies that obstruct women’s liberation.

There is, however, a glimmer of hope in Syria. This can be seen in the Kurdish-held regions, where a secular and egalitarian model has been implemented. The self-administered Kurdish authorities have adopted a system that rejects all forms of discrimination against women, establishing legal and social equality between the sexes. In these areas, Kurdish women hold around forty percent of local council seats, and female fighters play a prominent role on the front lines against a barbaric enemy.

In conclusion, it is clear that in societies shaped by religion and entrenched taboos, women are deprived of meaningful emancipation. The prevailing culture in many Arab-Muslim societies is one that enslaves the individual, with women as its primary victims.

The Islamisation of these societies, and the rise to power of Islamist forces in certain states, have rendered women the principal losers. They face patriarchal injustices drawn from Qur’anic verses that give men superiority in legal rights and inheritance.

In the twenty-first century, the condition of Arab-Muslim women has deteriorated to the point where they are reduced to a reproductive function. This generates profound frustration, particularly as these same women, through access to information and social networks, are exposed to more emancipated models. The sense of revolt that this stirs is understandable.

Syrian women, however, have a unique opportunity. They can align themselves with the minorities-making up thirty-five percent of the population-who favour secularism. This remains the only path toward enshrining a Common Law based on the principles of equality and parity between women and men.

In the face of the Islamic State’s barbarism, Muslim women have nothing to lose. They must adopt a critical mindset. They must question their belief system. They must scrutinise their adherence to a rigid, literalist interpretation of Islam. In this struggle, it is time for them-alongside enlightened men-to embark on the path towards secularism.
