<h4>Sectarian Thought and Intellectual Sterility</h4>

If sectarianism constitutes the most acute form of psychological isolation among individuals and groups, it likewise represents the most advanced stage of intellectual sterility. The mind enclosed within the confines of sectarian identity is deprived of renewal and creativity. As Nietzsche once observed, “The inability to exchange our thoughts with others is the most dreadful form of solitude.” The sectarian, encircled by the narrow boundaries of dogma, paralyses his capacity for reason, stifling thought at its very inception.

Examining the social dynamics of so-called primitive societies reveals striking similarities with many modern communities that continue to engage with their surroundings in instinctive, unmediated ways. The intense attachment to the primary group once served as a survival mechanism: in early tribal contexts, individuals relied on the collective for protection and meaning. The paradox is that many sectarian minds today continue to function within that same psychological framework, despite the passage of time and the development of civilised societies. They perceive the world through the lens of their sect, as though their intellect had never emerged from the shadows of the ancestral cave.

It is often the case that humans seek to emulate mythical figures who embody the collective aspirations and self-image of their group. In many so-called primitive societies, we find legends centred on a heroic founder—be it a prophet, warrior, or imagined saviour. A vivid illustration of this can be found among the Onondaga tribe of Native Americans, who wove intricate myths around their legendary hero Hiawatha. Through tales of his miraculous birth and triumphs, the tribe projected its suppressed desires and collective psyche onto this imagined figure. Such characters are sanctified and transformed into symbols of communal identity, serving to legitimise a sense of superiority over external ‘others’. These dynamics are not unique; they are echoed in the veneration of saints and prophets across religious traditions. Humanity seems to require a symbolic mirror—a figure from one’s own race, lineage or creed—through which the self may be elevated, affirmed, and projected onto the world.

Over time, these mythologised identities become the foundations of sacred belief systems, producing rituals and obligations that bind the individual more tightly to the group. The more intensely one identifies with the sect or tribe, the more one internalises its strictures—until these constraints become self-imposed chains. In this condition, the individual creates within their psyche a false paradise, where forbidden desires are justified so long as they are directed at those who fall outside the group’s symbolic order.

The sectarian perspective reduces the world to binary oppositions: righteousness is confined to one’s own group, while malevolence is invariably ascribed to others. This polarised worldview engenders a chronic sense of victimhood, feeding the fear that foreign influence will sully the imagined purity of the group. Consequently, any unfamiliar idea is rejected not due to its content, but because it originates from outside. As the old adage goes, “Man is an enemy to what he does not understand,” and so the sectarian becomes hostile to whatever he cannot categorise within his ideological system.

In this environment, the group’s insularity is transformed into a defensive mechanism, eventually adopted by individuals as a psychological necessity. A mental barricade is erected, obscuring the real source of anxiety. Rather than confront the internal contradictions and existential discomforts arising from within, the sectarian mind attributes its unease to external forces. The primitive psyche is unable to distinguish between anxieties born of self and those arising from the world. These compounded fears are often displaced and refigured as a false sense of superiority over the other.

This is the very soil in which intellectual sterility grows. A mind that merely recycles inherited dogmas without reflection or innovation becomes barren—incapable of posing new questions or imagining alternative futures. Thought withers in such sterile ground, much like an exhausted field that can no longer yield fruit. The tragedy is that this intellectual inertia is frequently mistaken for loyalty to tradition or fidelity to identity. What appears as steadfastness is, in truth, the slow death of the creative spirit.

Comfort may be found in this enclosure, for it relieves the sectarian of the burden of existential uncertainty. Pre-packaged answers replace the trials of individual enquiry. The world becomes simplified, conveniently interpreted through a prefabricated lens that demands no critical engagement. Yet this comfort is illusory—more akin to the stagnation of still water than to true tranquillity. A mind that avoids contradiction, that suppresses questioning, is one destined for decay. Just as the body requires resistance and challenge to remain strong, so too does the intellect demand exposure to difference, to that which lies beyond the familiar.

History is replete with examples of societies that have fallen into decline due to sectarian rigidity. A collective mind that refuses to engage with broader human experience is gradually reduced to a storehouse of obsolete customs and lifeless repetitions. In contrast, the vitality of civilisations has always been linked to the interplay of diverse perspectives. The flowering of knowledge has come from the cross-pollination of cultures, while the descent into ignorance has invariably followed the path of sectarian seclusion and ideological purity.

To break free from the stranglehold of sectarian thinking requires both personal bravery and a broader awakening. The sectarian must confront their fear of difference, embracing instead the discomfort of doubt and the liberating possibility of not knowing. Truth is never the sole property of one group or doctrine. When the mind is liberated from its confinement, it may roam freely in the wide-open fields of shared humanity. Such emancipation is not a betrayal of one’s roots, but rather a deepening of them—a way of enriching identity through dialogue and experience. As with trees, ideas cannot flourish in hardened soil; they need the air of freedom and the light of diversity in order to grow.

Ultimately, the sectarian mind remains inert so long as it orbits around a single axis. Intellectual sterility is not fate, but a condition borne of fear and enclosure. When the mind dares to tear down its walls and step into the unknown, it may rediscover its buried fertility. In doing so, the individual realises how much potential has been lost in the darkness of seclusion—and how quickly it may be restored by the illumination of universal thought.

And thus we find that all primitive collectives tend to view other groups as inferior. This is evident in the example of certain Native American communities, who believed themselves to be “God’s chosen people,” just as some Indian tribes called themselves “the people beyond whom there are no other people.” This illusion of superiority does not emerge from authentic excellence, but rather from deep-seated insecurity—an identity so fragile that it must define itself by elevating one group above all others.
