<h4>The Belligerence of the Abrahamic Covenant</h4>

My mind drifts, then collapses—it betrays me. I can neither focus nor accomplish anything. I attempt to rearrange my thoughts, to organise facts, only to falter before I’ve even begun. For a few minutes, I ponder the disease and its possible remedy, but I find nothing—nothing but a wild urge to stray even further. My mind is off, wandering the narrow alleys of the internet, seeking something it cannot name.

I roam through scattered websites, adrift along the digital pavements of the web, hoping to find a drop of clarity to soothe my curiosity, to slake my thirst for free thought. I flit from one Arab blog to another, only to be met with disappointment and an intensifying sense of alienation. Their intellectual offerings are all tainted, poisoned with toxins aimed at annihilating both mind and body. I grow mentally ill and descend once more to the harsh ground of reality. Then, just as I’m about to give up the search, parched and weary, I stumble upon my longed-for oasis: a virtual pub brimming with bold and stirring ideas—a Moroccan youth league alive with the energy and audacity that can inspire all who dare to dream of change.

“Youth for the Separation between Religion and Education” calls for the abolition of religious subjects in schools, the promotion of rational inquiry, and the pursuit of scientific knowledge. Their aim is to purge educational methods of religious instruction so as to build a culture that respects intellectual diversity and individual belief.

A cerebral shudder ripples through me as I eagerly begin leafing through their site, seized by a sudden, almost carnal intellectual pleasure. Their words touch me like a body newly discovered, the excitement of which brushes close to the moment of climax. I shake off the sensation and return to thought—this time, viewing the question of religion and education through the lens of neurological studies that have examined the influence of unconscious mental images on individual and collective behaviour.

Neurological science has exposed the mechanisms by which a mental image—acquired and stored in the unconscious—is transferred from the external world to consciousness. This same image may re-emerge, consciously or unconsciously, when triggered by a particular set of circumstances—a web of events and personal experiences linked together.

A close analysis of the imagery in religious texts reveals a recurring pattern of aggression, clothed in stories of violence and punishment. Antiquity teems with scenes of slaughter and sacrifice. Consider, for instance, the tale of Abraham’s willingness to sacrifice his son in obedience to God. This image has been carved deep into the unconscious of Abrahamic believers. And yet, curiously, it evokes no revulsion. No sense of horror is attached to the idea of a father raising a blade to his child—so long as it is done in the name of God. The believer does not see in this act a crime; rather, they perceive divine generosity and a symbol of loyalty. But if we strip away the symbolism—discard the meanings layered upon it over millennia—we are left with the raw image itself: a brutal act, an attempted murder of an innocent, helpless child.

This sort of imagery, which sanctifies the killing of the Other in devotion to God, conditions the faithful to view violence as legitimate. It becomes easier, then, to direct hatred towards anyone who dissents. And thus, it’s no surprise that many self-professed devotees adopt the same Abrahamic logic to punish those who challenge them. This aggression lies buried in the psyche of the believer, ready to erupt whenever external or internal stimuli align. The ideas of violent retribution and divine wrath become normalised. Such a worldview—completely at odds with modern humanistic values—is dangerous on two fronts: collectively, as in the case of Salafi groups; and individually, as illustrated by the tragic case of a carpenter in 1997 who, convinced he heard the voice of God, awoke, entered his infant son’s bedroom, and bludgeoned him to death with a hammer to re-enact the Abrahamic sacrifice.

Neurologist Michael Persinger studied such episodes of aggression linked to deep-seated unconscious imagery. He found that punishment and death—ubiquitous in religious iconography—are etched into the mind of the believer. These images surface as counterfeit divine voices, misinterpreted as commands from the heavens. Persinger explains that religious imagery is constructed from sensory impressions—heard, seen, smelt—and processed in the temporal lobe. When such data are decoded and distributed across the cortex, they quickly harden into belief and are mechanically activated to drive specific behaviours.

These aggressive imprints form part of the individual’s ego. They create a chasm between inner cognition and external reality, impairing the believer’s ability to comprehend anything that does not conform to the unconscious image. This interpretive straitjacket becomes even more perilous when it infiltrates the collective unconscious. At that point, violence and intimidation become the only means of engagement—at the level of the state, the school, and the family. Such collective programming explains the shrinking horizon of thought for individuals and societies that feed on these inherited aggressive images. There is no space for dialogue, no room for deviation. Only a single path is permitted—unchanging, dogmatic, and merciless. This is how tyranny is taught: through a culture of mental colonisation that dominates every aspect of life.

For these reasons, I do not hesitate to lend my voice to the Youth for the Separation between Religion and Education. I endorse their demands wholeheartedly, and I hope others will follow. Movements such as theirs deserve wider recognition and support across all Arab and religious societies. Their campaign slogan encapsulates it best:

“Do not colour me—let me choose for myself.”
