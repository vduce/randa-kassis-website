<h4>The Sons of Sin</h4>

Our Arab societies, one notices, are suffering from a culture shaped by the sin complex, which is firmly and strongly established in our religious doctrines and value systems. We are the grandsons and granddaughters of a culture of self-crucifixion and knowledge-flogging, inheritors of the original sin that is deeply rooted in us. Ours is a culture of hell and torture, engraved in our minds and desires — a culture built over time, gradually becoming entrenched in its doctrines, traditions, and immutable concepts. It does not refrain from criminalising any effort or attempt to soften its coarse and rough teachings. It directs the arrows of its masochists — those who reject all forms of change or renewal — at every form of criticism.

This culture teaches us to submit to humiliation, to fight against science and knowledge, and to belittle ourselves, so that we may perpetuate repression in both its individual and collective forms. But what is the main reason behind the development and endurance of such a repressive culture?

There is no doubt that the group has played an important role in shaping individuals within the framework of laws and traditions, which have taken shape over time and transformed into religious concepts that suppress any rebellious attempt in order to preserve the group’s existence and very essence. It does this by ignoring the individual’s desire. In order to restrain these desires, the group seeks to implant the notions of fate and punishment deep into the minds of individuals. This creates a psychological discrepancy between self-satisfaction and internal images loaded with fear and terror — images that remain in the unconscious. This inner conflict gives rise to a deep sense of guilt. Each time the individual attempts to satisfy their needs, they find themselves overwhelmed by a deterrent tendency stemming from internal images accumulated since early childhood. These images take hold of them completely, leaving them unable to grasp the true extent of the problem. They feel paralysed in the face of these images.

At first, these feelings were reflected in myths, and then materialised in the form of divine religious texts. This projection of inner fears gradually solidified into an external power that restricts individuals and suppresses any attempt to think or behave outside of its repressive framework.

The group has taken it upon itself to fulfil this mission. We see it targeting every individual who has liberated themselves from the shackles and chains of the collective. It wears the robe of the executioner — ignorant of all sciences, knowledge, and historical developments. This tendency is projected onto us in the form of another crisis — one that confuses moral values and basic concepts. The individual lives their entire life hiding behind false masks, practising moral hypocrisy in secret, disturbing the natural balance of things, and forging their history of repeated defeats into imagined glorious victories.

I believe that the primary problem in our societies lies in their fear of confronting themselves and their failure to reconcile individual desires with the collective interest.

Collective Arab culture is constructed on the incitement of individuals to irrational reactions and senseless violence. Our mental faculties are incapable of first identifying emotions in an organised way, and then transforming them into meaningful outcomes. Our actions are simply expressions of random, confused emotions, devoid of any ability to organise either individual or collective behaviour. And when we try to impose order, we find ourselves subjected to accusations and insults.

I am doing my best to identify the causes behind these closed reactions, which remain perpetually frightened of any external threat that might pull them up from their complacent foundations. I try to be understanding of these feelings, but at the same time I am compelled to question the reasons behind the conspiracy of the earth and the universe against this cursed part of the world for so long. I find myself lost in a hopeless search for exceptional inventions, only to find nothing but failure. I search for ethical values, only to find their complete absence. I delude myself into thinking it is worth searching further — perhaps we belong to a culture that could take pride in its remarkable scientific achievements — but I hear nothing other than weeping, moaning, and self-flagellation over a past that has left no trace.

We are the ones who destroyed our human achievements and annihilated our accumulated experiences. We cling to a single mask we created for ourselves — a mask emptied of all content and meaning, offering no reason to continue living.

Gripped by fear, we turn against one another and resort to violence against the other. We are always ready to pass judgement, to issue instant rulings pulled straight from our cultural drawers. How can we claim any association with knowledge or science when we are incapable of understanding ourselves or analysing internal and external realities?

If we examine our ambiguous situation — one shaped by a culture of indoctrination, misinformation, and fabricated truths — we should not be surprised that individuals are transformed into machines that can do nothing but passively store information, without knowing how to process or interpret it. We are the children of a culture that merely imitates others, incapable of converting potential into genuine creative output.

Ours is a struggle between the individual who aspires to exercise their basic human right to freedom — freedom of thought, and freedom to behave independently — and the group, which seeks to erase the individual’s identity and humanity within the crowded anonymity of the herd. The group seeks to tame them like a domesticated animal, following predetermined paths and shapes, to protect itself from the threat posed by their liberation.

Individual freedom represents a permanent danger to the fixed principles, traditions, and beliefs of the group. It is the story of an eternal struggle — between the collective’s drive to enslave the individual’s body and mind, and the individual’s hope to liberate themselves from the group’s oppressive control.
