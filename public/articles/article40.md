<h4>The Delirium of Prophets</h4>

Human beings engage with their environment through two interwoven perceptual experiences. The first is internal, arising from sensory interaction with the external world. Over time, however, this internal experience is shaped by collective structures and environmental influences, eventually forming a shared inner framework-what we might term the collective internal experience, manifesting as cultural norms and values.

The second, external experience is composed of a multitude of collective cultures accumulated through history, absorbing characteristics from different individuals and groups. This experience has evolved through observation and the study of natural phenomena, acquiring layered complexity across time.

Internal perception itself is further divided into individual cognitive experiences operating within a broader collective consciousness. This creates an ongoing interplay between the individual and the group. At times, individual insight enriches the collective, introducing new values or principles. Yet, in other instances, such personal experiences can produce psychological effects that, when unconsciously absorbed by individuals, harden into automatic behaviours and fixed beliefs-resistant to change or reinterpretation. This rigidity imprisons the individual within a narrow and inflexible framework, as seen in religious doctrines clinging to primitive moral codes no longer suitable for contemporary life, and whose continuation, in their current form, stands in stark contradiction to science and modern knowledge.

Before addressing the religious dimension within individuals and communities, I wish to explore the nature of internal perception and the fragile mental images that often dominate those who experience them. In particular, I refer to prophets and messengers, and the link between prophecy, high altitudes (such as mountain ascents), and fasting. Take, for example, Moses ascending the mountain to receive the Ten Commandments. To understand this phenomenon, we must examine the role of hypoxaemia-a deficiency of oxygen in the blood-which occurs at high altitudes and is known to affect activity in the temporal lobe of the brain. Factors that can induce hypoxaemia include elevation, rapid ascent, and intense physical exertion.

Studies of hallucinations and delirium experienced by mountain climbers-often symptoms of altitude sickness-shed light on why individuals seeking divine contact may have gravitated towards elevated terrains. Fasting, too, plays a key role. Moses is said to have fasted before his encounter with God. Starving the body alters brain function and can induce states akin to delirium. Hence, fasting and ritual deprivation have long been part of spiritual preparation among numerous tribal cultures-such as Native American rites-described by Michael Persinger as part of what he terms the “God experience”. Over time, this extreme deprivation was institutionalised in milder forms as partial fasting and incorporated into the obligatory practices of organised religions.

Persinger drew a critical distinction between the experience of God and the concept of God. He considered the former a subjective, internal phenomenon-an intense perceptual episode often marked by overwhelming emotion, an inner sense of revelation, and even auditory phenomena interpreted as the divine voice.

If we examine these internal perceptual experiences-whether interpreted as cosmic energy, universal consciousness, or a divine creator-we find they frequently arise from changes in brain activity. Such states may occur during periods of emotional crisis, exhaustion, psychological vulnerability, or personal transformation. These conditions enable the emergence of rich emotional states-feelings of psychological depth, fullness, or transcendence-that closely resemble hallucinations or perceptual distortions recorded by the brain in the absence of any corresponding external reality.

These hallucinations are conscious mental representations devoid of an external referent. They are internal perceptions projected onto an imagined outer reality, not unlike the experience of “God” as felt by some-an inward perception not anchored in objective, observable fact.

Undoubtedly, for many individuals, the experience of “God” was not a wilful act but rather the result of involuntary internal processes shaped by psychological tension and a desperate desire to escape one’s inner reality.

Returning to the prophets and their experiences of revelation: we find individuals who became immersed in internal perception, caught in prolonged hallucinations and states of delirium. Their experiences were not the result of a premeditated plan, but rather of heightened sensitivity and acute intuition-qualities that allowed them to seize moments of cultural and psychological opportunity. What is often referred to as the “sixth sense” may be nothing more than an accumulation of personal and collective experience stored in long-term memory, allowing for a certain predictive capacity or anticipatory insight.

Moreover, the cultural context of the time-abundant in gods, miracles, and mythical wonders-offered fertile ground for individuals to stand out by composing new legends and elaborating on divine narratives.

Now imagine if one of these individuals were to appear in our present day. We can assert with confidence that their destination would most likely be a psychiatric hospital or an isolated cell-so dangerous would their ideas be considered to the fabric of society.
