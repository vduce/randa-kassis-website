<h4>The Right to Differ in the Methodology of Thought</h4>

Following the failure of my “miraculous invention” to dissolve the hymen, and my inability to lead an army to conquer virginity-a failure naturally owed to the ever-watchful guardians of the sexual realm, sworn to thwart any attempt at plundering “masculine treasures”-I was reminded once more that, in our culture, to violate chastity is akin to violating one’s livelihood: both are sacred.

Some of the responses and emails I received revealed a certain incapacity among some readers to grasp the text in its entirety. Their replies were rigid, lifeless, and unable to unpack the symbolism embedded in the title. I suspect this stems from a general cultural tension around engaging with such sensitive subjects.

I’ve addressed the topic of perception in earlier articles, particularly its failure to comprehend what lies beyond the bounds of the individual ego-especially when the mind instinctively rejects the unfamiliar. Human beings, by nature, gravitate towards repetition. In neuropsychology, this is known as the preference for “affective probability”. As Zajonc explained, the act of selecting any mental representation is governed by a mechanism of preference. Hence, we often find ourselves endlessly replicating our own thoughts and methods, avoiding anything that falls outside our established cognitive patterns.

We frequently hear calls for diversity and the right to difference, couched in lofty slogans such as “freedom of expression”. But before we ask this of others, should we not first question our own capacity to suspend our cognitive egos long enough to read or hear what challenges them?

In my view, the essence of true difference lies in one’s ability to subject their thoughts and behaviours to constant self-critique, thereby attaining a broader awareness. This cannot be achieved while one remains obsessed with inflating the ego through the approval of others.

Let us briefly consider the methodology of thought and analysis in our Arab societies. More often than not, we remain prisoners of a single approach-regardless of whether we identify as proponents or opponents. I believe this stems from the inability of some writers, artists, and thinkers to step beyond the confines imposed either by their audience or by themselves. They become captive to a familiar path and are quick to pass judgement on anything that does not conform to their own intellectual frameworks.

And the matter goes deeper still. The Arab mentality-including its religious variations across sects-is often shaped by an uncreative mindset grounded in repetition and mimicry.

True, the expression of ideas-whether through writing, art, or any meaningful endeavour-ought to carry a sense of commitment. But that commitment should not be confined to a single aim or method. Every purposeful work is, in essence, a product of accumulated personal experience, infused with ideas from various cultures, and brought to life through the force of imaginative creativity.

Before speaking of diverse ideas and varied approaches, we must reflect on the nature of our collective thought from a historical perspective. We’ll find that the religious culture in our region has long been predicated on the notion of “the singular individual”-that is, change occurs only through a handful of exceptional figures.

This invites the question: were prophets and messengers merely figureheads moved by hidden powers seeking domination? Or were they rebels who defied the harshness of their environments? In either case, they remain embodiments of a monolithic cultural model-one whose roots persist to this day.

We are still searching for a mythical saviour to deliver us from our tragedies by some miraculous means. And many among those who fight for human and women’s rights remain unable to accept diversity in perspective, in analysis, and in solutions.

There are no absolute answers, nor singular readings. Change is not brought about merely by urgent desire. It is realised through the emergence of individual groups with differing views-each approaching reality from varied angles, grounding their analyses in multiple disciplines. There is no single lens through which to interpret a concept, no one remedy supported by one study alone-but rather a series of experimental approaches.

As for our societies-suspended in a kind of coma-they must first be jolted by powerful shocks before any healing can begin.

Before entering any battle, we must first rediscover ourselves-to understand the buried motives that have led us to adopt one mode of thought over another. When creative work becomes a tool for flaunting the ego, then all efforts at remedy become futile. When we approach others through a narcissistic lens, projecting our own concepts and desires onto them, we inevitably abort every sincere attempt-no matter how modest-that might mark the beginning of a collective exit from this narrow tunnel.

I believe true change can only emerge by reshaping the psychological fabric of each individual-so they may discover their own distinct and unique nature. Only then can final goals be identified and pursued through individual methodologies that remain flexible and open to evolution.

That is why we must first liberate ourselves from the prison of self-evaluation, so we might later free ourselves from the judgement of others. Our journey through life should not be reduced to a mere quest for validation, but rather a long process that begins with aligning our actions with our thoughts, and both with the laws of nature.

I won’t prolong this further, but I do wish to clarify something for those readers who, on occasion, project their own egos onto my writings: I do not write to please, nor to glorify my own ego. My writing is an attempt to extract all my mental images-so I may sing as I please, within the orbit of my own goals, whose contours I have only just begun to draw.

What I seek is to shape a new cultural model-one that is not constrained by egos, ideologies, nations, or religions.
