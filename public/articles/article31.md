<h4>The Ego’s Enmity Towards Freedom</h4>

Most often, we make sense of ideas in relation to how much they correspond with our own private notions. Take, for instance, the moment we encounter a face and attempt to assess its relevance to us: a complex neurological operation unfolds, wherein some regions of the brain identify the person while others retrieve associated memories or relational links. This cooperation between different neural functions informs the conscious stream of recognition and response.

We could say, then, that our perception and assimilation of external data—particularly that conveyed by others—are caught in a continuous dynamic of either collision or agreement. If we examine more closely how individual egos respond to texts, words, and expressions, we find their reactions rooted in biology. These responses are directly tied to personal experiences stored in long-term memory, which naturally differ from one person to another.

Our understanding, then, and the way we process or respond to stimuli, is filtered through the complex structure of the ego—an ego that contains within it a measure of imagination. We can never truly claim objectivity, but we can choose to engage with unfamiliar ideas—those lying outside the usual framework of our individual perception—by refining the ego in the pursuit of knowledge and discovery.

Ego structures differ widely according to cultural and social backgrounds. Anthropologists refer to this as the “cultural model.” It has been observed that individuals who confront texts alien to their own culture often struggle to comprehend them. As a result, they tend to reconstruct these texts, attributing to them meanings more in line with their own cultural understanding—meanings which often diverge significantly from the original intent. In some cases, the foreign or unfamiliar is flatly rejected. In this context, British psychologist Frederic Bartlett proposed the notion of cognitive schemata, shaped by both instinctual drives and later developments such as ideals, moral codes, and the collective or individual interests embedded in various societies.

I begin with this premise in order to explore some of the mechanisms behind our individual responses to ideas that differ from our own. My aim is to examine the phenomenon of the failure to truly listen to, or comprehend, what another person is trying to express.

Personally, I am convinced that this difficulty is intimately linked to the condition of the ego. We must learn to relinquish, even partially, that insistent ego always seeking to assert itself. We must come to see that an ego different from our own does not negate our individuality—rather, it may complete it. Only then might we begin to fill the vast empty spaces between us, to broaden our perception and find an affinity with the ego of the other. And from that place of connection, we could extend our attunement to all living beings—and even to nature itself. Perhaps only then can we reconcile ourselves with the death instinct, embrace freedom, and return to inanimate matter—where rest is absolute, unconsciousness complete, and existential strife dissolved.

It follows, then, that we ought to strive not to overcome death per se, but rather to live and die without suffering. Our fear of death is ultimately a fear of pain and obliteration. This is why I support any attempt that seeks to dismantle the mechanisms of tyranny and break free from the vicious circle of struggle fostered by the ego—attempts that ultimately lead us back to the principle of freedom itself.

Perhaps my words will be interpreted in ways far removed from what I intended. But I accept that. I believe in the legitimacy of all individual attempts at understanding—so long as one does not fall into the trap of self-righteousness. We are all breathing through this self; all of us are striving to affirm the ego, to improve our existence, to overcome the structures that suppress the other. This is the collision between the reality principle and our instincts—the postponement of the pleasure principle in favour of civilised acts of sublimation.

Yet we must ask: are not all forms of sublimation simply redirected flows into the receptacle of the ego—reinforcing it and misleading it, historically and instinctually? In other words, I believe that transcendence and sublimation, when lacking awareness of external realities, only intensify the ego’s imprisonment within rigid visions and beliefs. Were not myths, religions, and ideologies forms of unconscious collective and individual sublimation—so powerful that they turned us into a flock unable to grasp the depth of experiences concealed behind mere words?

Looking more closely, we observe that those who are enclosed within their own cultural constructs—and here I use “culture” in its broadest sense—struggle to engage with unfamiliar ideas. They are often swayed by alluring words that they neither feel nor understand. This discrepancy between their actions and their speech reveals itself in glaring contradictions.

Yes, we are all susceptible to falling into the trap of the ego—the ego that believes it already knows everything. But through the accumulation of consciousness and sincere attempts to engage with thought, we can restrain it, relativise it. In doing so, we open the way towards wider horizons, where we can truly encounter the other. When we pass through the walls that separate egos, we begin to connect with other selves, reaching a deeper and more expansive mode of understanding.

What we need today is to excavate both individual and collective experiences, and to reconcile the reality principle with the instinctual and the pleasurable. This reconciliation is only possible through a journey into the past—and through the realisation that there is a fragment of truth in every proposition, in every human experience. What we seek is complementarity, not cancellation.

Before I conclude, I would like to draw attention to a particular point: the inflation of the ego is a universal human trait, but it is especially noticeable in our Arab societies. Consider the common tendency to mock the other and belittle their serious efforts at expressing their individual self. Would it not be more admirable to refrain from such judgements? It is easy to espouse tolerance in speech, but far more honourable to embody it in action.

It is all too easy to fall into the ego’s trap—to rush into rejecting ideas that do not conform to what we deem true or correct. But we must resist this impulse, and persuade ourselves that knowledge is attainable only by expanding our perception—by consciously choosing to think beyond our narrow personal desires and interests.
