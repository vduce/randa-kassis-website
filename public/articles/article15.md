<h4>The Street’s Revolt and the New Artisan of Peoples’ Destiny</h4>

There is no doubt that numerous factors enabled the Wahhabi brand of fundamentalism, emanating from Saudi Arabia, to tighten its grip and extend its influence over the deepest fabrics of Arab societies—societies still plagued by poverty, soaring unemployment, corrupt governance, and the widespread persecution, brainwashing, and marginalisation of individuals.

These fundamentalist movements not only benefitted from the suffocating conditions endured by their targeted social structures; more significantly, they found themselves thriving within a vast cultural vacuum. Arab regimes, in their ruthless pursuit of systematic repression against intellectuals and activists, inadvertently carved out a gaping chasm between the public and those intellectuals who retreated behind the gates of an elitist ghetto. That withdrawal only deepened their disconnect from the general populace.

One of the consequences of this intellectual ghettoisation was the emergence of a discursive and linguistic impasse, marked by the use of abstruse terminology and complex rhetoric. This, in turn, became an added barrier fuelling the rupture between intellectuals and the public. The language they employed lacked the mental imagery necessary to reach and resonate with the everyday individual. Psychological studies have illuminated this phenomenon—often referred to as the “independence complex”—which suggests that ideas evolve into independent cognitive units before they can be absorbed. From a neuropsychological standpoint, ideas influence individuals only when mediated through emotions. Abstract concepts must first be transformed into sensory images, which then coalesce into a psychological experience capable of leaving a lasting imprint on the mind.

Taking the Tunisian revolutionary experience as an example—a movement sparked by the spontaneous uprising of young men and women—it is vital to recall that this revolt did not emerge from a void, nor was it solely the consequence of Bouazizi’s self-immolation. Rather, it unfolded in a climate of intense tension, to which Bouazizi’s tragic act added fuel.

This uprising could not have endured without the support of several enabling factors along the way. Chief among them was the role played by the new media. A prominent group on social networks known as Takriz had, for many years, garnered a considerable following by grounding their posts and blogs in the tangible realities of Tunisian youth.

Founded in 1998 on the Internet by a group of Tunisian youths using various pseudonyms, Takriz began with two core members and gradually expanded into a movement with tangible influence over the daily lives of countless young Tunisians. One major element that bolstered the connection between Takriz and successive generations of youth was the group’s use of street-inspired slang—language devoid of decorum or pretension. At times, their expressions bordered on the vulgar, perhaps deliberately so, as a way to capture attention and resonate more directly with their audience. Their goal was to bring down the oppressive Tunisian regime, and the group’s administrators remained faithful to that mission, avoiding the lure of public accolades. They played a pivotal role in galvanising and coordinating the January uprising.

This brings us back to our initial point—the rupture between Arab intellectuals and the general public, a breach that paved the way for Islamist movements to flourish and embed themselves within the susceptible minds of disillusioned youth. These movements not only grew in influence but deepened the sense of abandonment felt by a generation who increasingly resembled a forsaken child.

Under such circumstances, Islamists found it easier to establish ties with broad segments of society, largely because they had social programmes, financial resources, and a mastery of emotionally charged language. This is the language of emotion—of indistinct, uncritical thought. In stark contrast, most intellectuals clung to a convoluted, inaccessible discourse laden with affected expression, readily excluding any ideas that failed to align with their worldview.

Among the other reasons that facilitated the proliferation of Islamist fundamentalism, perhaps the most critical was a deeply entrenched scepticism towards the project of Arab nationalism. Islamists were, to a great extent, the only ones who succeeded in capitalising on the collective sense of defeat among Arab nations and their longing for an identity that transcended national borders. This erosion of trust stemmed, in part, from the way Arab liberation movements were contained—diverted by the opening of external warfronts—and the subsequent imposition of a perpetual state of emergency. This cultivated a general climate of fear and led to the people’s ultimate surrender to authoritarian rulers.

Thus, it became easy for Islamist movements to stoke the psychological need for a historic victory and offer a sense of identity that could replace the failed Arab nationalist dream. In doing so, they encouraged people to forsake their Arab identity in favour of a broader religious affiliation.

It is high time for these nations to confront the reality before them, abandon collective identities, and embrace the primacy of the individual in order to reclaim a wider space for freedom. Progress will then be achieved through the emancipation of individuals within a broader societal context. No one can offer others what they themselves lack. Individual fulfilment and self-sufficiency are essential prerequisites to attaining this vision.

Let us now consider another factor that aided the rise of Islamists: the double standards and double-speak adopted by many Western governments. On the one hand, they boast of democratic values and profess an unwavering commitment to human rights; on the other, they sustain alliances with authoritarian regimes that share their strategic interests. For instance, while the West—and particularly the United States—frequently condemns human rights abuses, little is said about the violations perpetrated by their close allies, such as the Saudi royal family, which rules its people with an iron fist.

Saudi Arabia is by no means the sole violator of human rights in the world. I focus on it here because it is the epicentre of Islamist ideology and the primary financial backer of movements seeking to Islamise Arab and other societies alike.

In my view, it is impossible to stem the tide of fundamentalist Islamism without a decisive stance from the West. There must be an end to the unchecked power and influence of its autocratic allies. These regimes must be isolated, and all diplomatic ties with them—Saudi Arabia foremost among them—must be unequivocally severed.

Now is the moment for the West—and for us—to place our trust in the younger generations who are demanding change. They are the new artisans of destiny. The young men and women of Tunisia and Egypt have demonstrated the merit of that trust by overcoming not only their dictators but also the passivity of their own intellectuals. They have emerged as the true thought leaders of the Arab world—educators to those still perched upon rhetorical thrones and clinging to outdated expressions and ideas disconnected from the lived realities of their societies. These young revolutionaries have also managed to surprise Western politicians and disrupt their long-standing arrogance and illusion of control over the destinies of others.

This article summarises a symposium (held on 9 February 2011) in which I participated alongside several speakers at the Société de la Presse Française. In my intervention, I explored the close relationship between oppressive regimes and the rise of Islamist movements throughout the Arab world. I also explained how these regimes managed to survive by persuading Western governments that their stability served as the last defence against the further spread of Islamism.
