<h4>Syria’s Identity: The Richness of Minorities</h4>

In light of the fierce battle waged by the regime against its own people, it has become increasingly evident that the opposition’s leadership is struggling to respond effectively. There are several reasons for this: foremost among them is the absence of a diverse foundation of political parties within the Syrian body politic—save for the Kurdish parties, who, despite enduring harsh repression, have long been engaged in activism and moments of heightened mobilisation. Another key reason is the lack of pluralistic thought embedded within Syrian culture and society.

The Syrian regime has played a pivotal role in nurturing and activating a singular trend within the consciousness of individuals, by constructing a monolithic cultural model. This model has been built upon a framework of curated information and accumulated memories, which are then used to reinforce a specific culture—resulting in a unified vision and strategy.

Such a model limits individuals’ capacities for understanding what might be considered creative or constructive processes. It fosters mental rigidity and an unwillingness to entertain alternative interpretations of reality. Evidence of this can be found in the striking similarity between the discourse employed by the Syrian regime and that of the opposition. Despite their ideological differences and fierce rivalry, the dominant modes of rhetoric, analysis, and strategy appear remarkably alike.

The regime relies heavily on stirring up fear among minorities—be they ethnic, religious, sectarian, or ideological—of the political Islam present among some of the regime’s opponents. This fear becomes a vital card in the regime’s hand, enabling it to recast the conflict as a binary one: either with or against Assad. For instance, the regime often exploits Arab nationalist sentiments which, by their nature, position all ethnic minorities as subordinate. We witnessed a similar bias during the recent Cairo conference of the Syrian opposition, where some displayed a rigid stance regarding the recognition of the Kurdish people’s rights, despite the fact that Kurds are indigenous and deeply rooted in this region.

Many Syrians continue to view the Kurdish issue through the lens of conspiracy. In anticipation of potential recognition of their rights, they accuse the Kurds of plotting secession and seeking to establish an independent Kurdish entity in the region. It is imperative to recall the long history of Kurdish resistance against the Syrian regime’s oppression. Since the days of Hafez al-Assad, Kurds have played a significant role in Syria’s broader struggle. Their persecution began as early as the 1950s, culminating in the racially motivated 1962 census—signed by President Nazim al-Qudsi—which stripped over 120,000 Kurdish citizens of their nationality, launching a systematic campaign of marginalisation.

History bears witness to the deep-rooted connection of the Kurdish people to the Syrian homeland. This will become more apparent during a transitional phase of independence, in which citizenship is upheld as a fundamental right. Yet, the rise of Arab nationalist sentiment marked the beginning of discrimination across Syrian society, particularly the denial of even the most basic rights to ethnic minorities.

Addressing the Kurdish issue—acknowledging past wrongs and seeking to redress them—serves to advance the revolutionary cause and to lay the foundation for a nation built on equal citizenship. For this reason, it is also essential to speak about other minorities, notably the Alawite sect, which constitutes an integral part of any solution. Winning the trust of the Alawi community could hasten the collapse of the Assad regime by opening channels of dialogue with individuals who might serve as influential intermediaries. The opposition must embrace inclusive national rhetoric, ensuring that Alawis are part of Syria’s future political landscape.

Alawis and other religious minorities are gripped by a deep fear of persecution. We must not overlook the Alawis’ history of suffering, preserved in our collective memory—replete with experiences of marginalisation and discrimination dating back to the time of Sultan Abdulhamid. Recollecting this history is crucial if we are to break free from the legacy of historical isolation and extreme poverty that gave rise to stark class divides. It is by revisiting these traumas that we can hope to transcend the current atmosphere of tension, where all groups remain in a state of constant defensiveness.

What is sorely lacking in this climate of high tension is the inclusion of the silent segments of society, as well as those aligned with the regime, who, much like their counterparts in the opposition, are acting from a position of self-preservation. Bringing these groups into the fold could enrich the uprising and help it reflect Syria’s national diversity more faithfully.

In this regard, I believe that upholding the principle of credibility—especially in terms of news and information—will benefit us greatly. It could help reassure those frightened groups whose only current motivation is a yearning for stability, security, and calm.

We must also recognise that there are obscure elements within the revolutionary movement that are, whether knowingly or not, serving the interests of Assad and prolonging his grip on power. The violent acts carried out by certain factions within the opposition are often in pursuit of narrow self-interest. While these actions have rightly drawn criticism, they should not be allowed to undermine the broader importance of the revolutionary movement. Instead, we must work to expose such actors and isolate them, ensuring that the struggle does not descend into sectarian conflict—a scenario that would only serve the agendas of regional powers.
