<h4>Reviving the God from Within: The Roots of Inner Conflict</h4>

Neuroscience and psychology have revealed much about the internal struggles of the human mind—particularly the tension between the rational clarity that governs us during the day and the illusions and imaginings that overtake us at night. These nightly visions transport us to the mazes of childhood, to distant memories accumulated over time, memories that shift in form, merge with others, and create entirely new mental images.

Let us explore the origins of gods, religions, and myths—phenomena shaped by cumulative human experience, rooted especially in early childhood, according to various anthropological, psychological, and neurological studies. If we examine the relationship between humans and gods, it becomes apparent that it mirrors, in essence, the parent-child dynamic. Yet it is childhood anxiety that pushes this relationship into another realm, granting it broader reach and emotional force. This evolution did not unfold in a direct, conscious manner, but rather through a shared linguistic framework—one that fused divine traits with lofty and benevolent words. Likewise, the system of reward and punishment between parents and children was mirrored in the divine-human relationship, forming the foundation of many religious doctrines.

The neurologist Michael Persinger shed light on this link, arguing that the child’s need for basic biological necessities—food, warmth, affection—met by parents, becomes projected onto the divine. Hence, we often find that meals are accompanied by expressions of gratitude to God. This also explains why many missionary religious organisations distribute food and drink; the divine becomes closely associated with satisfying primal human needs.

A child clings to their mother because she provides nourishment, safety, and comfort. Yet, as time passes, the sense of guaranteed protection wanes—parents, after all, do not live forever. Here begins a psychological compensation for the loss of childhood security, driven by the child’s inability to take responsibility or defend themselves. Thus, the parental figure is gradually replaced by an omnipotent force—a mighty, boundless god. This helps us understand the presence of feminine deities in early cultures, particularly in matriarchal societies, and how their gender shifted over time with the transition to patriarchal structures.

After extensive fieldwork among Australian tribes, the anthropologist and psychologist Geza Roheim confirmed the role of childhood in the invention of myths and deities. He built upon insights from paediatrician and psychoanalyst Donald Winnicott, who found that the mother’s image evolves in the psyche of the child—from a gentle, nurturing figure to that of a witch or monster—resulting from her inability to meet all the child’s needs. This transformation appears in countless myths of female demons or flesh-eating spirits who punish men—such as the fearsome figure of Kanarintia, who visits men at night, sits on their genitals, and subjects them to judgement and punishment, sometimes mutilating or even killing them with her poisonous sexual organ. These primitive embodiments of divine punishment and mythology find their roots in the mother-child relationship.

Among the Pitjantjatjara tribe in Australia, for example, women are affectionate and tender with their children, yet are said to consume the weaker among them, offering greater care to the stronger ones. This form of selection mirrors patterns in the animal world and resonates with the theory of natural selection.

Such practices also spark in children a buried urge for revenge. Some specialists suggest that demons and spirits symbolise the child’s repressed desire to penetrate and devour the mother’s body. As the psychoanalyst Melanie Klein explained, 'The child projects their aggression first onto the mother, then the father, becoming immersed in fantasies of bodily destruction'.

It is likely that the very bond between mother and child—from conception in the womb to the trauma of birth—played a central role in producing childhood anxiety, which later fed into mythological and, eventually, religious storytelling.

This anxiety cannot be resolved peacefully. It is filtered through conflicting emotions and an overwhelming sense of guilt. The psyche thus splits into binary oppositions—good and evil, heaven and hell, God and the Devil. One cannot exist without the other. All humans grapple with these internal contradictions, yet a conscious will can guide us towards deeper understanding and more thoughtful choices.

By contrast, the person who surrenders unquestioningly to their god and religion—without reflection, without scrutiny—resembles a child oblivious to the world around them, surrendered to parental protection. That same state of submission and comfort is later transferred to a divine figure, relieving the believer of the burden of thought and responsibility.

We notice, then, that associating divinity with certain grandiose terms does little to help individuals distinguish between illusion and experience. It impedes the pursuit of a more profound understanding—one that transcends demons, sorcerers, and deities altogether. These exalted terms form a linguistic barrier that obstructs our conscious will to examine history and its ailments, and to craft new frameworks that address our biological and psychological needs, without necessarily clashing with collective values.

Thus, control over individuals is often exercised through linguistic pathways embedded in memory, becoming automatic responses devoid of empirical grounding. If one asks, 'Who is God?', the answer often arrives instantly—yet it is usually empty of analysis. God has become the ready answer for anyone who cannot, or will not, engage their mind.
