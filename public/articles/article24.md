<h4>Men of the Cloth and Their Neuroses</h4>

As time passes, we observe an increasing hysteria surrounding religion in Arab societies—albeit with varying degrees from one to another, depending largely on differences in social structures and historical heritage. This hysteria, which engulfs both individuals and groups, entraps them within the confines of an oppressive religious authority and transforms them into marionettes manipulated by the clergy. It is precisely for this reason that I believe we are entitled to question the mental health of these self-proclaimed ‘spiritual leaders’, as well as their legitimacy to assume the role of moral guides to individuals and society—especially given the unprecedented proliferation of global religious channels, financed either by official bodies or covertly supported by state institutions.

Let us then psychoanalyse these so-called thought leaders who exert a powerful and direct influence on individuals in societies where, unfortunately, such a role is monopolised by religious figures. The overwhelming volume of fatwas—most of which obsessively revolve around sexual matters—is worthy of serious consideration. These rulings are presented as nothing more than the fulfilment of divine will, and as a yearning for a paradise constructed entirely on the premise of sexual excess. It is therefore our right to question this contradictory and obsessive preoccupation with sex, which exposes a neurotic condition widespread across religious societies. These societies are, on the one hand, deeply committed to frozen moral codes, while simultaneously harbouring a growing obsession with pornography, a diminishing sense of personal productivity, and a general air of dissatisfaction.

Some may attribute this condition solely to economic hardship and oppressive regimes that consume and squander the raw potential of their citizens. However, we must also shed light on the foundations of the oppressive mindset itself. Tyrannical governments draw their strength and authority from religion, reflecting, with great clarity, the child’s submission to a despotic father figure. The oppressive psyche manifests in three key dimensions: first, the father as absolute master, extended through his sons who enforce his law; second, the Almighty God, represented on earth by religious institutions and embodied by clergymen granted a divine mandate; and finally, the same authority channelled through autocratic governments personified by a ruler at the helm.

From a psychoanalytical perspective, we must seek to unveil the secret behind this sexual obsession so characteristic of the clergy. Clinical studies have long demonstrated the impact of repressed biological instincts on the control of individuals—redirecting sexual energy as a force driving collective interest. In this process, the individual is neglected, and in exchange, granted a sense of belonging, continuously reinforced with a feeling of security. This sense of security, however, serves only to anchor the individual within a sphere that fortifies the dominant power. Yet the tyrannical mind is ultimately incapable of truly providing security—hence religion’s constant promise of compensating for the lack with an imaginary paradise.

Likewise, the notion of a tyrannical family unit led by a domineering father nurtures a culture of self-restraint and suspicion towards the other—particularly those who are different. This self-restraint dovetails with religious notions of sexual repression and the rigid structuring of sexual conduct. Genuine happiness, however, arises from fulfilling basic biological needs and the pursuit of pleasure. This pursuit is crucial to the individual’s psychological maturity, yet this biological imperative is systematically distorted and repressed.

Wilhelm Reich’s clinical research traced sadomasochism, rape, and a host of neurotic behaviours back to cultures of repression and sexual prohibition. These are not natural desires but rather perversions born of distortion—behaviours twisted by the moral codes imposed by prohibitionist mentalities. Real happiness and fulfilment compel individuals towards genuine creativity—something that becomes possible only when the pleasure principle is allowed to unfold under natural, rather than repressive, laws. Because moral codes grounded in repression are inherently incompatible with the pleasure principle, it becomes necessary for individuals to begin by denouncing the sexual and psychological abuse inflicted during childhood and adolescence by the family, and to extend that rebellion to the moral codes imposed by spiritual authorities. This initial defiance may eventually escalate into broader political dissent, creating the possibility of a new social dynamic.

Let us return, then, to the clergy—and interrogate the disturbing similarities in their behaviours and mental patterns, which appear to be symptoms of a common neurosis. They often exhibit sadistic tendencies towards their wives and masochistic tendencies in their interactions with the state. Their objectives are closely aligned with those of oppressive governments: to enforce total submission of the individual—whether through physical oppression (as is the norm in repressive regimes) or through psychological violence (institutionalised within religious practice). The clergy and their supportive governments have entered into an unspoken marriage of mutual interest, yet remain deeply resentful of one another, awaiting the first opportunity to bring the other down should disagreement arise. If we look more closely at the psychological roots of these two modes of oppressive authority, we see that a childhood marked by repression and sexual deprivation cultivates behavioural traits passed through generations. While it is true that part of our behaviour is biologically driven, the external environment plays a crucial role in selecting which behaviours take root. As neurologist Gerald Edelman noted, the environment is not fixed; it evolves in concert with the behaviours it fosters.

The oppressive construct appeals to individuals genetically predisposed to it. It inflames latent sadistic tendencies and expresses them through a dominant cultural paradigm. There exists a psychosomatic connection between the body and the psyche—an understanding that has led to holistic treatment methods aimed at healing both at once. This is the foundation of biodynamic therapy pioneered by psychologist Gerda Boyesen, whose work has been recognised by the European Association for Psychotherapy.

The aggressive and destructive impulses described by Reich and many others in psychology and psychoanalysis stem from the rejection of the sexual instinct—which, in its natural state, is oriented towards peace. Violence and aggression, in essence, are maladaptations of the basic drives that fail to find peaceful resolution. Pleasure, once denied, mutates into a sadistic form—a blend of primal sexual drive and secondary destructive energy. This is a biological condition, shaped and transformed by the surrounding culture. Sadism may also serve as a defence mechanism triggered by deep-seated anxiety, manifesting in casual behaviour or in sexual conduct. Thus, the clergy experience a perverted pleasure when violating individual rights—particularly those of women. Male anxiety, rooted in the fear of castration, fuels sadistic behaviour towards female partners.

Let us revisit the concept of patriarchal societies where the Oedipus complex becomes a sociocultural phenomenon, rather than a purely biological one—as demonstrated by anthropologist Bronislaw Malinowski in his study of matriarchal communities in the Trobriand Islands. Members of these tribes enjoy natural sexual freedom. They are socially organised, productive without excessive complaint, and largely practice monogamy.

The Oedipus complex, then, is the consequence of an oppressive conception of fatherhood. One may reasonably argue that the relationship between paternal authority, religious power, and political tyranny is deeply intertwined. The patriarchal masculine force feeds directly into the rise of clerical power and the expansion of despotic regimes.

Religion, it seems, attracts neurotic personalities. Perhaps such individuals should be confined to mental health institutions where they can recalibrate their bio-electrical energies—where, perhaps, they might even come to experience pleasure in its natural form. They may then cease projecting their inner turmoil onto society. Perhaps it is even the nature of religion itself that is to blame, for it seems to draw in such disturbed souls with uncanny consistency.
