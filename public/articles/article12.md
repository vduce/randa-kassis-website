In the first part, I paused at the mechanism behind the evolution of consciousness. In this article, I turn to a more contemporary theory: the Theory of Neuronal Group Selection, proposed by Gerald Edelman, a biologist and director of the Neurosciences Institute in La Jolla, California.
Edelman divided consciousness into two levels: primary consciousness and higher-order consciousness—the latter being distinguished by its greater complexity and cognitive depth.

What is primary consciousness?

Edelman posited that primary consciousness arises from two systems within the nervous system.

The first consists of structures such as the brainstem and the limbic system. This network governs essential biological functions including feeding, sexual behaviour, and defensive strategies—functions shaped and inherited through evolution. It also oversees other basic processes like respiration, sweating, and sleep. In essence, it forms the foundation for survival and is present in all organisms equipped with a nervous system.

The second system is the thalamo-cortical complex, which includes the thalamus-the central hub of the brain composed of various nuclei responsible for relaying sensory signals to the cortex. This complex acts as a gatekeeper, filtering incoming information: amplifying some signals while attenuating others.

Over evolutionary time, these two systems became interconnected, giving rise to what Edelman calls primary consciousness—a capacity enabling living beings to adapt to their environments. Learning thus becomes the essential mechanism of adaptation in both humans and animals, as the environment is not fixed but constantly shifting across time and space. Nature, through selection, eliminates maladaptive structures and preserves those that adjust effectively. Behaviour, rooted in environmental experience, is shaped by this process of learning, driven fundamentally by the need to meet physiological demands and the impulses governed by the brainstem and limbic system.

According to Edelman, primary consciousness developed in parallel with evolution, and was enabled by three key mechanisms:

1. The cortical system, which allowed for the integration of cognitive concepts with emotional processes, thereby expanding the brain’s capacity to learn.
2. A novel form of conceptual memory, capable of organising and categorising inputs from various brain systems, thus enabling the classification of perceptual processes.
3. Reentrant loops-complex neural circuits that permit continuous, recursive exchange of information (feedback) across connected structures. These loops enable memory to process perceptual classification in real-time, facilitating adaptive responses.

Edelman, alongside Giulio Tononi, emphasised the importance of the thalamo-cortical loops in the emergence of consciousness. They argue that primary consciousness in both humans and animals stems from the interaction between short-term memory and perceptual classification—a dynamic interplay that gives rise to conscious experience.

While organisms with primary consciousness can form internal images, Edelman contended that they lack the ability to observe those images through the lens of a social self—a distinctly human capacity that emerged with the evolution of higher cognitive functions. Higher-order consciousness enables the brain to link each mental representation to others, forming interconnected chains of thought.

We thus distinguish between perceptual classification, which interprets sensory input from the external world, and conceptual classification, which occurs internally, relying on memory to shape abstract concepts.

Although this capacity is most developed in humans, studies suggest that chimpanzees also possess elements of self-awareness. The development of individuality is closely tied to social interaction, through which one constructs a model of the world by connecting past, present, and future—a process requiring symbolic memory. The evolution of vocal tracts and brain regions involved in language comprehension and production was instrumental in the development of spoken language, which in turn played a central role in the expansion of human consciousness and the emergence of the self.

These social interactions, and the resulting ability to store symbolic relationships over extended periods—through the convergence of multiple memory systems and the emergence of experience-based memory enabled humans to link the past with the present and imagine the future. This played a pivotal role in the development of higher-order consciousness.

According to Edelman, the brain is subject to two selective processes: natural selection, and somatic selection, the latter being a refinement within the former. These mechanisms enable the brain to connect sensory signals with mental representations, leading to the formation of consciousness based on the interplay between perception, conceptual frameworks, and memory—all shaped by a value system that evolved over time.
In The Biology of Consciousness, Edelman explains how higher-order consciousness contributes to the emergence of imagination, emotion, sensation, thought, selfhood, and volition. Human behaviour, he argues, is driven by memory, which is itself shaped by reclassification processes that respond to biological shifts and evolving value systems.

When considering these modern theories, it becomes evident that our engagement with concepts—whether social or religious—is rooted in an ongoing process of transformation across time. There is no fixed perception, no immutable concept. Rather, the values we ascribe to the external world stem from a consciousness that is itself in flux, adjusting in response to life and nature.

Over millions of years, evolution has selected for learning mechanisms that enable living organisms to adapt to varying environments. Thus, morality—emerging from our perceptual evaluation of phenomena—is not static, but evolves as our perception shifts, either generating new values or abandoning those no longer suited to the changing external context.
