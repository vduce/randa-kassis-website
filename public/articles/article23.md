<h4>Argument for a National Deflower Day</h4>

I have, for a long time now, heard persistent voices calling for sexual equality in male-dominated societies. I am not an activist in this regard, as I have chosen to live far from that particular struggle, so that one day I might delve into the essence of life in its comprehensive, existential meaning. That said, the ongoing debate has led me to reflect on the subject and attempt to understand some of the obstacles preventing women from lifting themselves out of their dark, stagnant ponds. I believe such transformation will only be possible through a radical shift in feminine behaviour and dreams.

The patriarchal order has long entrenched a masculine construct that serves only its interests. It has installed itself as the ultimate purpose of a woman’s life—her sacred aspiration from early youth—an idea, of course, reinforced by the notion of God and religion.

Undeniably, patriarchy has dehumanised women, reducing them to mechanical slaves who glorify their executioners. Worse still, it has made them enemies of their own bodies and foes to their fellow women. Most so-called advocates of women’s rights are, ironically, among the most aggressive towards other women.

But let us first interrogate the meaning of equality. Before anything else, it implies equal rights and duties—equality in civic life, employment, and citizenship. Yet herein lies the crux: how can a slave offer what they themselves do not possess? Constant pleas and grievances are futile when directed at a male-dominated society whose very structure is built upon exclusion and stratification.

Look closely: the Muslim views himself as God’s beloved, the Christian as a vessel of divine grace. The wealthy regard their material fortune as proof of superiority, believing themselves entitled to privileges others must forfeit. Those who claim intellectual authority, meanwhile, are unable to tolerate unfamiliar ideas—whether scientific, philosophical, or otherwise. They inflate their egos while rejecting what they cannot grasp.

Amidst this grotesque and colourful collective ego, the voice of the feminist—or even of the ordinary woman—is drowned out. Her voice becomes a distorted echo of masculine ideals. She clings to her virginity, not out of personal conviction, but in the hope of gaining male sympathy and validation. She saves it for a romantic moment, a gallant knight, the man of her dreams—as if she were presenting him with a platter of diamonds. She reduces herself to a reproductive organ, making it the cornerstone of her identity. And she lashes out at anyone who dares attempt to liberate her.

It is time to pause and examine the negative role women themselves often play in reinforcing their own subjugation.

Patriarchal society feigns sympathy, insisting that women are unsuited for labour or physical endurance. In the name of compassion, it confines them to the domestic sphere—where they are ostensibly loved and respected, but in reality are humiliated and subjected to the whims of impotent macho men incapable of fulfilling their emotional or physical needs.

Sexism wears a flimsy cloak, barely concealing the hypocrisy of masculine double standards, particularly in the moral codes of religious societies. Morality, in such contexts, is a tool shaped by masculine interests and values.

In the West, the feminist struggle has been marked by women’s relentless efforts to secure their rights, often through organised demonstrations. History remembers the names of women who played pivotal roles during moments of upheaval—particularly during WWII, when women entered the workforce en masse and were recognised as an economic force. These feminist demands were supported by collective action and a vibrant literary movement. Yet despite legal reforms and formal equality, the struggle for genuine parity remains ongoing.

Now, let us return to women living under patriarchal regimes. Their path forward must include a persistent struggle for civil rights—employment, inheritance, divorce, monogamy, and more. But material participation alone is not enough. Women must engage in a complete act of emancipation—one that includes material and emotional independence.

She must no longer see a man as necessary to fulfil her aspirations. Only then will emotional freedom be possible, and that, in turn, demands the abolition of all gendered attributes—maternal instinct, feminine softness, masculine gallantry—all of which perpetuate sexist constructs.

In these societies, women are made to feel physiologically inferior. The female reproductive organ is seen as less worthy than the male’s. Such beliefs are not innate but imposed by the culture in which they were raised.

That is why I propose that the female reproductive organ be reimagined—not as a symbol of submission, but as a weapon of resistance. What if women united in a peaceful strike, refusing relationships and reproduction? Society would come to a grinding halt. No children. No heirs. A collective pause until further notice.

But beyond symbolic gestures, women need tangible solutions to reclaim confidence in their own bodies. Their sexuality must become a means of emancipation, not a tool of enslavement.

Feminist organisations carry the responsibility to raise awareness—especially among women in positions of power. These women must dismantle patriarchal narratives, amplify their voices through media, film, and literature.

When a woman awakens from her rosy nightmare—the husband as a saviour, the dream as marriage—when she stops viewing him as her life’s purpose, only then will change truly begin. Life is not reducible to romance or familial roles. It is deeper, vaster than security or social constructs. It is a tapestry of skills, suffering, and a journey through culture in search of the self—reformulating, again and again, the images within.

Freedom comes at a cost. And women must be willing to pay it. This means giving up romantic illusions, relinquishing superficial victories, and ceasing to revere the hymen as some sacred attribute.

Women do not need external saviours to gain their freedom. Their rights can only be won through an intellectual revolution—one that begins by tearing down the myth of a God who upholds female subjugation. This revolution must uproot every religious remnant that enshrines women’s inferiority.

She must cast aside the fear that burrows deep within her mind, awaken her latent strength, and pierce the false hymen society has placed upon her. She must cease viewing other women as rivals for male approval. Women must unite—declare a general strike against the laws and customs that shackle them and strip them of their essence.

And why not begin with the declaration of a National Deflower Day?
