<h4>The Pinnacle of Pleasure and Consonance</h4>

This is a follow-up to the previous article, as I felt it warranted further clarification. I wanted to begin with the expression “a struggle for existence”, a phrase employed in various ways and often taking on aggressive overtones that inflame a confrontational stance towards the other. At face value, it appears to be a legitimate argument for self-preservation. Increasingly, this attitude has become central to the way groups and individuals interact with those outside their sphere. At this point, we must ask ourselves about the affinities between the principle of the struggle for existence and the principle of domination.

Let us begin by briefly examining our biological system to determine its primary aims. The continuation and prevalence of this system rests on the principle of responding to and fulfilling basic biological needs-such as food, water, and sex. Undoubtedly, these necessities are at the core of our survival. However, at a later stage, they grow more selective and sophisticated in their pursuit of heightened sensations that go beyond mere sustenance, seeking instead an elevated pleasure. This stage, however, presupposes a developed level of consciousness as expressed by individuals.

For this reason, we can assert that the struggle for survival is, at its core, the satisfaction of basic needs in order to attain the highest levels of pleasure and enjoyment. Yet the principle of domination has managed to distort this process, transforming pleasure into an ongoing battle between groups and individuals. Even more profoundly, it has ignited an inner conflict between the individual self and the prevailing values of the external environment. The individual becomes lost in the labyrinth of religions and moral codes. At first, one subjects their own instincts to the most advanced forms of internal torture, eventually extending this self-censure to others. Nowhere is this more evident than in the manifold restrictions placed on sexual drives, which in turn become generalised into a wider repression of the very notion of pleasure. According to Wilhelm Reich, the sexual drive does not seek pleasure-it is its very engine.

Ferenczi observed that the diminishing satisfaction of certain sexual drives arises under a range of pressures exerted by cultural norms, prompting individuals to forsake pleasure in the name of self-preservation-here understood as the conservation of sexual energy. Let us not forget, to use Reich’s own words, that orgasm during intercourse is about the eruption of a hidden biological energy, free of moral restraint or inhibition. Orgasm represents a complete release of the internal contents stirred by sexual arousal. This is why Reich believed that a harmonious relationship with one’s partner allows both parties to reach pleasure. The ego should not be in a conflictual relationship with reality, nor should it limit itself to external constraints at the expense of sexual drives. Male ejaculation or the experience of partial pleasure in female sexuality-when disconnected from their corresponding sexual drives due to prolonged arousal-does not guarantee the release of sexual energy. Without such release, they will not attain the point of orgasmic satisfaction, which is vital to a psychologically and physiologically healthy existence.

Let us return to the influence of religion on sexual energy, particularly in how religions attempt to organise and structure this energy within the collective unconscious of individuals. Such interference hinders psychological maturation and prevents individuals from gaining responsible sexual experience, which would otherwise allow them to seek pleasure in a fulfilling manner. Only then can individuals regulate their sexual relations in responsible and autonomous ways. Cultures built upon the model of a god ruling over slaves can only mirror the image of that god. Through their moral codes, they perpetuate the representation of a powerless being, entirely alien to pleasure and enjoyment.

Let me return now to the consequences of repressing individuals. This repression often drives them into delusions and fantasies as a means of compensating for unrealised pleasure. Certain schools of psychoanalysis hold that such acts of repression regress individuals to an infantile stage, marked by the most primitive mental features of human infancy. Sexuality, as interpreted by men raised in a macho cultural framework-which prevails across numerous societies whose laws are rooted in religious teachings-is almost always anchored in the image of invasion and penetration of the female body. This image, in turn, is underpinned by an unconscious rapist mentality. From a psychoanalytic perspective, it reflects the male’s desire to compensate for a sense of deficient masculinity, resulting from a psychological regression to early childhood. This regression rekindles the desire to overcome the trauma of castration and the deep-seated sense of inadequacy that stems from paternal prohibition. The repression of sexual energies often finds misguided outlets in perverse practices and accounts for the resurgence of infantile fantasies and irrational mental constructs.

Let us now revisit the principle of domination. As outlined above, it does not align with the struggle for existence, for the biological system is sustained only when its essential needs are met. Domination, by contrast, serves merely to substitute individual pleasure with an energy redirected to serve group interest, often at the expense of the individual.

Delgado established a link between aggression and the pain experienced by subjected individuals, functioning through a system of rewards and promotions. Religions operate according to the same logic of punishment and reward. They promise a heaven that tantalises the fantasies of the faithful-offering in the afterlife what was denied to them in this world. This abstract and illusory pleasure derails individual fulfilment from its natural course and blocks the imperative of releasing sexual energy as a path towards enjoyment. It substitutes real pleasure with an intangible one, thereby causing biological disturbances in the proper functioning of the sexual organs.

In conclusion, I can only add that the notion of a god who controls instincts and drives is fundamentally at odds with our pursuit of awareness-a level of awareness that enables us to engage in sexual relations based on mutual desire, to attain intense orgasms and foster a healthy biological system. This can only be achieved when our instincts are in agreement with our convictions. A religious person practising abstinence and self-restraint knows nothing of enjoyment, for they are perpetually under the unconscious impression that they are committing a sinful act-one forbidden by the gods.

The goal is not to encourage unrestrained sexual activity, but rather to arrive at a point where our thoughts and instincts are reconciled. It is only then that we can push thought forward and escape the maze of sterile and relentless arousal. Perhaps, one day, we may attain the most advanced level of harmony with nature-allowing us to reach out to everything around us, to sail within its vastness, to overcome our lingering fears, and to journey towards the no-place, the a-temporal, the no-thing, where our fragmented selves converge into a state of absolute freedom.
