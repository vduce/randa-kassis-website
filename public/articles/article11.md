<h4>Memory and Consciousness — Part I</h4>

There is no doubt that the cultural framework — encompassing beliefs, customs, and behaviours — is a product of the level of consciousness within a given society. Equally, it is undeniable that we all strive to elevate our consciousness to grasp what currently lies beyond our understanding. It may also be necessary to revisit the past in order to comprehend what was once obscure to humankind — to understand how humans became prey to psychological fears, which they sought to suppress through myth, spiritual practices, and eventually, religion. With this in mind, I have chosen to clarify in this article the mechanism by which the brain has evolved over time, drawing on certain contemporary neurological theories.

Michael Persinger contends that changes in two fundamental brain structures — the hippocampus and the amygdala — contributed to our acquisition of two key traits: the capacity for memory and for evaluating events. He argues that memory is grounded in emotional charges and sensations, driven by the principles of reward and punishment. Persinger concluded that over time, stimuli affecting the hippocampus enabled the reactivation of past memories. These memories, in turn, were embellished by human imagination and fantasy. The amygdala, meanwhile, evolved into a central hub for regulating emotions associated with experiences, allowing us to feel joy, delight, or intense depression. From this, it becomes clear that memory — particularly long-term memory — forms the foundation for the development of human consciousness, enabling us to store accumulated experiences across time.

Gerald Edelman added another vital concept to our understanding of brain development: the notion of value, which is linked to personal history and the experiences it produces. The brain’s evolutionary capacity to form mental representations and internal scenes, he argued, emerged from this store of experiences — preserved in long-term memory as both cognitive and emotional values.

Henri Laborit, for his part, explored the influence of social culture on memory, suggesting that it generates a kind of automaticity in the individual, which he called “cultural categorisation”. According to Laborit, culture and the surrounding environment shape the course of memory by filtering information in accordance with the group’s cultural norms and its shifting needs. In order to define individual need within a collective framework, he proposed that such need represents a quantity of energy or information required to sustain neural structures — whether innate or acquired through learning. He described this mechanism as a stable transformation in neural connections: cells produce peptide chains that generate proteins, which in turn form new neural links in response to external stimuli.

In this context, “need” becomes a primary driver. Within a collective setting, however, these needs can only be fulfilled through the principle of “group dominance”, which transforms the balance between internal and external needs into a tool of control over others. It is through this process, according to Laborit, that hierarchical structures between groups emerged.

The more deeply we delve into what occurs within the human brain from a scientific standpoint, the wider the gap becomes between us and the superstitious thinking that still prevails in many cultures. This superstitious mindset forms a kind of inherited cognitive barrier that hinders the mind’s openness. We cannot transcend this barrier without a rigorous scientific pursuit of the unknown. Only through science and knowledge can we expand our awareness. If we were to journey through the brain guided by neuropsychology, we would discover countless mental representations — both conscious and unconscious. Yet only conscious representations have the power to break the automaticity of thought and to generate new laws and insights through awareness.

Focusing on Edelman’s theory, we see that he offered an explanation for the evolution of the human brain. In his book The Biology of Consciousness, he described a reciprocal relationship between genetic influences on behaviour and the impact of behaviour on genes. He asserted that the environment plays a role in selecting certain behaviours through natural selection. Yet, he also argued that individual behaviour, in turn, shapes the process of natural selection within the environment. Moreover, Edelman highlighted the importance of morphology — the study of form — in the development of consciousness, suggesting that this process arose from the gradual selection and evolution of the nervous system, a phenomenon referred to as morphological evolution.

Let us pause briefly to consider the relationship between genes and natural selection, in order to understand how behaviours that are not genetically inherited can still be acquired. Before we do so, it is worth offering a short historical overview. Gregor Mendel was the first to lay the theoretical foundations for genetics, paving the way for further exploration into heredity and evolution. This progress ultimately led to the integration of Darwinian theory with genetics into a unified scientific framework, allowing researchers to explain the connection between genetic function and natural selection.

To shed further light on the development of neural structures in the brain, it will also be useful to examine the history of how consciousness itself emerged and evolved.
