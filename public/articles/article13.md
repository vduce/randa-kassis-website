There is no doubt that cultural structures and historical heritage vary considerably across Arab countries. Yet, despite these differences, totalitarian regimes throughout the region repeat and reproduce the same mechanisms of repression to which they subject their populations. This is because the very architecture of these regimes—and the power apparatuses that sustain them—are shaped by analogous developmental processes and rest upon a similar psychological foundation. Totalitarian regimes are inherently incapable of comprehending anything that transcends their repressive tools and methods.

Likewise, although revolutions differ significantly in structure, intensity, causes, and consequences, it is possible to discern shared denominators and commonalities in the general conditions that give rise to them, as well as in their primary objectives.

Revolutions that have occurred in various parts of the world and in differing historical contexts have generally been the product of a conscious ferment, simmering beneath the surface as a result of a collective experience of hardship and suffering. If we examine the underlying mechanism of revolutions carefully, we find that such events are preceded by various stages of unconscious accumulation.

Individual subjects typically begin by observing their social grievances in silence, yet with a conscious awareness. They attempt to resolve these issues through civil society institutions, wherever such institutions exist and wherever a minimal degree of freedom is granted. However, when such channels are absent, or when intellectual diversity is stifled, the capacity to transform awareness into reform becomes severely constrained. In such contexts, individuals confront a political system governed by a totalitarian logic, dominated by a singular orientation that excludes all diversity of thought and sentiment.

Totalitarian regimes draw their strength (and, indeed, their fragility) from the systematic suppression of any individual effort to think independently or seek solutions to social problems without the intervention of the state. These regimes often respond to such initiatives with severe physical and psychological punishment.

In these systems, acts of independent agency aimed at improving society can be so thoroughly marginalised that they are often mistaken for mere expressions of general frustration or anger—outbursts triggered by the continuous repression of libidinal forces and human drives. Individuals trapped within the iron grip of a despotic regime suffer acute psychological afflictions. Their frustration may manifest in distorted behaviours and internal contradictions. On the one hand, they attempt to convince themselves that no escape is possible, that survival requires surrender. This surrender becomes a kind of deliberate apathy. They may even begin to adopt the slogans propagated by their repressive regimes, using them as a form of compensation for the absence of fulfilment or self—actualisation.

Through this apparatus of repression and deliberate marginalisation, despotic regimes seek to obliterate both individual identity and intellect. They pervert the human subject, turning them against their own desires and aspirations. In this context, one must acknowledge the role of religious institutions, which are tactically mobilised to cultivate religious extremism. Despotic regimes understand all too well that their survival depends on the intellectual and psychological suppression of their people.

If we examine the Syrian regime as an example of this phenomenon, we find a longstanding and deliberate effort to encourage fundamentalist religions within Syria. Its relative success in maintaining control over Syrian society hinges on this duplicitous strategy. On the surface, it presents itself as a secular government, restricting the freedoms of certain Islamic fundamentalist groups that openly challenge its authority. Yet, simultaneously, it plays an active role in spreading a culture of religious fundamentalism at a broader popular level. In doing so, the regime manufactures a justification for excluding and suppressing religious groups deemed to have an anti—government agenda.

This duplicity is also evident in the Syrian regime’s foreign policy. It has actively disseminated narratives and ideas that bear little resemblance to reality or to the concealed intentions behind its policies. The regime has succeeded in persuading both its own citizens and other nations in the region that it supports the oppressed and colonised peoples of the Middle East and that it represents the beating heart of Arab nationalism. Its propaganda rests on empty slogans, bolstered by a few media stories and official statements. In truth, however, this regime does not hesitate to offer concessions or compromises—whether to real or imagined adversaries—if doing so ensures its continued grip on power.

The regime has also tirelessly propagated the notion of conspiracy, exaggerating external threats from neighbouring countries to compensate its people for their repressed desires. A Syrian citizen is led to believe that they hold immense significance in the region, that their usurped ego is in fact collective, not individual. This collective ego is presented as perfectly aligned with the identity of the regime. The notion of conspiracy and foreign threat serves as a psychological sedative, accounting for the widespread submission and complacency among many Syrians.

Of course, the Syrian people are not the only population subjected to such manipulation. The same political tactic is deployed by other totalitarian regimes, and particularly by religious groups whose ideologies stand opposed to progress, transformation, and the very principle of life. The conspiracy theory becomes the only palliative available to a people who have nothing new to contribute to humanity and who are no longer capable of understanding anything beyond their narrow systems of belief and knowledge. Certainly, competing interests exist between nations and global powers seeking dominance—but totalitarian regimes habitually use such tensions as a pretext to suppress their own citizens in the name of foreign policy.

To understand the psychological mechanism by which oppressed individuals come to adopt the very slogans and vocabulary of their oppressors, one can turn to Robert Zajonc’s theory of the mere exposure effect. According to Zajonc, repeated exposure to a particular idea renders it more palatable. The brain, compelled by frequency, begins to favour this stimulus. In other words, the mere repetition of an idea enhances its acceptability and may even cause it to be internalised as truth—particularly when it corresponds with emotional impulses or psychological motivations such as fear of punishment or hope of reward. At that point, the individual mind loses its capacity to perceive reality with clarity and detachment.

The more deeply a totalitarian regime sinks into despotism, the more it imitates the structures and strategies of religious belief systems. This enables it to enslave every element of the society it rules. The Syrian regime serves as a prime example. The attempt to elevate the head of state into a quasi—sacred figure, to be venerated by citizens who live through and for the ‘leader’, is grounded in psychological manipulation. The goal is to dissolve the individual ego within the symbolic figure of the ruler, creating a shared emotional structure that is endlessly reinforced by media propaganda. Ironically, this mechanism may produce a perverse sense of identity—one that is occasionally rewarded with trifling privileges which pale in comparison to the regime’s own hoarded power and wealth.

Let us return to those preliminary, unconscious phases that precede revolutionary outbreaks. Having outlined some of the mechanisms of psychological repression faced by individuals, we can observe how such apparatuses reach a point of perversion in which repressed individuals voluntarily and consciously adopt the language and logic of their oppressors—thus becoming agents of repression themselves.

And yet, the unconscious mind does not accept this alienation. It rebels against the psychological crisis and seeks an outlet. This is the stage of unconscious fermentation: a violent internal struggle between the ego and the unconscious. When shared by many within a single cultural context, this struggle becomes a collective drive—a form of group therapy, a shared attempt to find a way out of an unbearable condition. In psychoanalytic terms, the unconscious perpetually seeks to mitigate suffering and process the negative drives repressed by social structures. Under such strain, even a minor external trigger can provoke an eruption. Suppressed impulses spill forth, first gradually and then in the form of conscious collective action aimed at radical transformation.

Revolutions are, at their inception, an unconscious effort. The psychological desires and shared drives of individuals accumulate over time, eventually converging into a conscious force for change—often without the backing of any prior political or social structures equipped to absorb the shock of transformation.

At this critical juncture, the role of intellectuals and experts becomes vital. They must help to structure and guide this raw, apolitical, and socially unanchored desire for change. A theoretical framework must be developed to support revolutionary movements, helping them navigate the disorder of revolutionary periods and their aftermath. This intervention is not meant to contain or subdue the revolutionary impulse, but rather to offer a forward-looking vision and to lay the foundations of diversity for future political and social engagement.

It is also clear that revolutions can unleash counter-revolutionary energies that work against their founding principles. We have witnessed such dangers in the aftermath of the Tunisian and Egyptian revolutions. The sudden rise and mobilisation of religious fundamentalism in both countries illustrates how revolutionary movements remain vulnerable to being hijacked, and how their democratic aspirations can be thwarted. Political Islam is capable of distorting the original motives that inspired revolutionary action, transforming them into new instruments of repression—not unlike those wielded by the very regimes they sought to overthrow.
