<h4>Sexual Intercourse and the Return to the Womb</h4>

In a previous article, “The Sex and Death Syndrome”, I explored the underlying fear within the male psyche of losing his genital organ. In this piece, I turn to examine the psychological roots of that fear, commonly known in psychoanalysis as the castration complex.

Otto Rank proposed that the origin of this complex lies not merely in the threat of genital loss but in the foundational trauma of birth-specifically, the moment of separation from the mother. This interpretation draws upon ontogenesis, the study of an organism’s development from conception onwards. Building on this notion, Ferenczi theorised that the act of sexual intercourse, from an ontogenetic perspective, is an unconscious attempt to release the psychic tension associated with birth and to recapture the emotional warmth and completeness of prenatal existence.

The concept of alloplastic adaptation, as formulated by Freud, Ferenczi, and Alexander Franz, rests on the idea that the organism adapts to external pressures in one of two ways:

• Through internal transformations in response to its environment, a process known as autoplastic adaptation;
• Or by actively reshaping the external world to better suit its needs, which constitutes alloplastic adaptation.

Returning to the notion of re-entering the womb, we observe this desire manifesting symbolically in the sexual act across species. For example, copulation among certain spiders can last several hours, while in some parasitic species, the male remains embedded within the female’s body in a state of permanent union.

Following extensive studies of copulation in the animal kingdom, Ferenczi concluded that ejaculation-accompanied by separation from the female body-is a symbolic re-enactment of birth. It is a psychological repetition of the first traumatic rupture that expelled the human being from what he perceives as his original paradise. That paradise, in this view, is none other than the intrauterine state, while the expulsion from it symbolises the moment of birth.

Ferenczi explained how psychic pressure builds up in the body, only to be released through the genital system. This release then radiates outward in a wave of satisfaction, a moment in which the entire organism becomes subservient to the sexual organs. The ego, in this state, merges fully with the executing organ-the penis-during intercourse.

This leads us to Geza Róheim’s interpretation of the soul as a metaphor for sperm. Since the ego momentarily identifies with the penis and its sexual secretions-as Ferenczi posits-and since the act of separating from the sexual partner recalls the trauma of birth and its attendant fear (which, for the male, is symbolised as castration), the male is able to imagine a return to the womb through the female genitalia.

The female, however, cannot imagine such a direct return to the maternal womb and thus seeks to compensate for this inaccessible pleasure through the desire to possess the male organ as a symbolic conduit for that impossible return.*

This may explain the male association between semen and the soul-an association absent in the female experience.

Scholars have not limited their inquiries to these early ontogenetic factors and the psychological unease they produced. These primal experiences have driven human beings to navigate vast imaginary landscapes expressed through art, religion, and mythology-all of which reflect the deep-seated desire to return to a state preceding birth. This yearning, perhaps, explains the striking convergence of myths across distant cultures and civilisations.

From the perspective of phylogenesis-the evolutionary lineage of species-research extends beyond the moment of birth to examine environmental catastrophes that shaped the fate of living beings. One such event, the recession of water levels, compelled some aquatic animals to migrate onto land in order to adapt to their altered environment, in accordance with Lamarck’s theory.

Ferenczi suggested that sexual reproduction within the female womb symbolises not merely biological necessity, but a substitution of the aquatic environment with a similar enveloping space-the womb as an echo of water. He even proposed that the struggle between sexes for penetration may have contributed to the development of aggressive masculine traits, particularly following the male’s successful penetration of the female.

Palaeontology continues to confirm the radical transformations that living organisms have undergone, just as biology increasingly substantiates many hypotheses first formulated within psychoanalysis. Those who doubt these scientific foundations, citing competing theories, often neglect the interconnectedness of scientific disciplines. Science does not progress through contradiction alone, but through synthesis and overlapping insights.

For instance, those sceptical of Lamarck’s environmental adaptation or Darwin’s natural selection would do well to consider the theory of the Irish botanist Hugo de Vries, who argued that biological change occurs not gradually, but through abrupt, discontinuous mutations. These spontaneous leaps give rise to new traits, after which natural selection filters the most suitable adaptations over extended periods.

Here, I find a meaningful parallel between de Vries’s conclusions and Ferenczi’s hypothesis. Both attribute the origins of transformation to crisis: in the case of de Vries, to phylogenetic catastrophes that leave lasting traces within the living cell; in Ferenczi’s, to personal traumas that imprint themselves in the genital organs and are released through the act of intercourse.

Sex, from this perspective, is far more than a physical act-it is a symbolic endeavour to reverse the foundational expulsion from the womb and to reconnect with the serenity and totality of pre-birth existence. Though such a return is forever barred, the human being remains driven to simulate it-through the body, through the unconscious, and through symbolic rituals of desire, separation, and the eternal longing for origin.

Note: The paragraph marked with an asterisk *-which addresses the idea of the female’s desire to possess the male organ as a symbolic substitute for returning to the womb-belongs to a specific tradition within Freudian psychoanalysis. It does not claim to offer a universal interpretation of femininity or gender, but rather reflects a symbolic reading shaped by particular cultural and theoretical contexts of its time.
