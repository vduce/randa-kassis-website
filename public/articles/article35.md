<h4>No Freedom for the Thieves of Freedom</h4>

Whilst boasting of their god’s forbearance, 'believers' are often the first to cast accusations at those who differ from them. They perpetually whinge and whine, claiming to be victims of moral persecution—especially when they constitute a religious minority in foreign societies which, according to them, are curtailing their freedoms.

Here, one must pause to question the very meaning of freedom—a notion alarmingly absent from their mental lexicon. These 'believers' subscribe to nothing beyond monotheistic thought, to the One and Only, to that which must not be questioned, let alone criticised. They go to great lengths to extract from their sacred lexicon powerful terms to reproach the other, bestowing on all who differ from them a series of damning labels. It hardly matters whether that difference is religious, ideological, or merely a matter of social conduct. In the eyes of 'believers', a spectrum of differences is lumped together and condemned indiscriminately as moral depravity, deviance, or deliberate distortion of their sacred truth. They then assume the divine duty of re-educating and redirecting others towards their flimsy doctrines.

Ever inventive in their tactics, resourceful in their crusade against those who stray from their gospel, the 'believers' employ various forms of assault that may be grouped into three main categories. First comes the assault on expression, executed through orchestrated attacks on websites, blogs, and platforms. This might seem relatively civilised when compared with the next two: verbal assault, often involving a barrage of insults, curses, and threats aimed at silencing dissent; and assault on life, where beheading becomes the ultimate expression of righteous wrath, manifesting an unspeakable degree of cold-blooded violence.

And yet, after committing such acts of brutality, the 'believers' come forward to cry foul, complaining of disrespect, claiming their beliefs and personal freedoms have been violated. At this point, it becomes imperative to question the boundaries of personal freedom and assess the positions of all involved in this debate.

Let us begin with religious fundamentalists residing in Western societies. Their demands appear selective, invoking freedom to justify everything from veils to all manner of obscuring attire. Who can say these demands won’t soon extend to praying in the middle of roads, calling for the closure of pubs and bars, banning alcohol, and condemning sexual liberty? Who knows where this spiral of infinite demands—made in the name of personal freedom, religious respect, and wounded sensibilities—might lead?

Time and again, 'believers' lecture us on respect and tolerance, all under the banner of personal freedom. And yet they never extend the same courtesy to those who differ from them. For only they possess the truth. Only they are the chosen lovers of Allah. Their god has allegedly granted them the exclusive privilege of divine knowledge. This imagined chosenness becomes their pretext for imposing their will with neither scruple nor restraint, justifying their repression and tyranny as divine mandates.

They are constantly on the hunt, seeking to silence anyone who dares express an opinion, question a belief, or explore an alternative path. At this juncture, we must earnestly consider a new framework for this debate, one that redefines personal freedom and establishes fair, reciprocal boundaries. Both sides—the believers and the other—must be equally bound by the principle of freedom of opinion and expression, without mutual persecution. As the situation currently stands, the onus falls on the 'believers' to acquire the culture of 'accepting the other' and to strive for a form of religious maturity. For now, they behave like unruly children, wailing whenever they hear something disagreeable.

Yes, regrettably, the majority of 'believers' remain psychologically immature. They perceive every differing opinion as betrayal, and every criticism as an attack. Thus, before clamouring for their own freedoms, moderate believers must clearly and openly condemn the culture of 'killing the other and sanctifying his blood'. They must do so without hypocrisy or equivocation, and with a sincere effort to ban religious programming that legitimises such ideology and glorifies this hatred.

We must also interrogate the position of those who defend the rights of religious tyrants to exercise 'freedom' based on the annihilation of others—indeed, on the annihilation of freedom itself. There are many who claim not to approve of these crimes, yet rush to shield the perpetrators in the name of tolerance. From where I stand—open as my stance may be to dialogue—I believe we need to take unambiguous, honest positions, free of hypocrisy and untainted by vested interests.

Let me return once more to those who cling to belief systems grounded in a singular, unchallengeable truth—beliefs governed by a tyrannical, repressive god, guilty of crimes against humanity, against life, nature, and the cosmos itself. A god who possesses nothing but the sword and the dagger. A god of ignorance, the wellspring of hatred in the souls of his followers.

Out of love for life and death, out of reverence for freedom and for nature and all its creatures, let me say: we have no duty—no right—to defend the 'freedoms' of those who violate freedom. We must not allow them to weaponise against us the very principles we strive to nurture—principles that aspire to a shared horizon of life and liberty, and to values that transcend local dogmas.

This is our battle—a pursuit of a deeper, less biased understanding of the external world, a setting aside of the ego to better encounter the Self, and through it, to touch the essence of other selves. This is the journey of a living being within the heart of nature. A quest for a freedom that surpasses divine decrees. A journey into the very core of the self, stripped bare of pretence.

Perhaps I sound radical in my convictions. But I believe freedom comes at a cost. And that cost is the unyielding stance we must adopt against those who would muzzle us and sabotage our progress. These programmed humans, fed with prescribed information, are incapable of thought beyond regurgitated dogma. They operate in herd-like unison, forming a homogenous mass fundamentally at odds with the diversity of nature. We are nature’s multiplicity—they are its parasites. By monotheising truth and virtue, they have surrendered to a mechanical doctrine, closed off to discovery or change.

But nature knows no mechanical laws. It is ever-changing, always in flux—as understood in physics, as moving, transmissible energy.

It is now urgent that we protect this journey by exposing those who would turn our values against us to destroy both us and the freedoms we cherish. We must strip them of the very liberties they misuse. Let us draw a clear line around a foundational consensus: No freedom must be granted to the slaves of the god of ignorance and ruin.
