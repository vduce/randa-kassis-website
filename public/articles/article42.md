<h4>The Unconscious: Between the Fixed and the Fluid</h4>

Psychology, in its various schools and branches, has offered us a deeper understanding of the self and of our inner psychological stirrings. Yet some still cast doubt on its status as a science—a scepticism which, in my view, arises less from objective reasoning than from deeply rooted beliefs and psychological resistance. This hesitancy may, in part, be traced back to the early stance of the behaviourist school, which rejected mental processes as legitimate explanations for observable behaviour. Behaviourists remained firmly opposed to concepts such as consciousness and the unconscious, while cognitive psychology initially adopted a neutral position, only later beginning to engage with these notions in earnest in the 1980s.

Today, we observe a growing convergence between dynamic psychology (psychoanalysis) and cognitive science. Both psychological schools and the field of neuroscience increasingly agree that most human and animal behaviours stem from underlying, unconscious processes. Following Bowers’ 1984 experiment—and subsequent studies such as those by Weinberger and Hardaway in 1990—researchers from both traditions reached the conclusion that unconscious representations play a fundamental role in shaping our thoughts and emotions. In essence, the majority of our cognitive, emotional, and motivational processes are unconscious by nature. Consciousness, by contrast, is limited in scope. Its primary function lies in enabling self-awareness of thoughts and feelings, thereby helping us to adapt by constructing a dynamic relationship with our environment. It also serves as a regulator of thought and behaviour.

The 2000 experiment by Naccache and Dehaene demonstrated that consciousness can determine the psychological and neurological outcomes of unconscious cognitive operations—that is, consciousness can influence unconscious mental representations. This opens the door to practices such as self-suggestion, which allow us to modify certain behaviours or pursue specific desires by consciously encoding motivating cues that are later activated unconsciously, or by formulating conscious strategies that affect deeper, unconscious mechanisms. Conversely, the unconscious influences us through a bottom-up process, wherein information rises from the depths of the psyche into conscious awareness.

Two mechanisms are thus at play: the descent from consciousness into the unconscious (top-down), and the ascent from the unconscious into consciousness (bottom-up). The older idea—held by some—that the unconscious is primitive and fixed no longer holds ground in contemporary science. On the contrary, psychology and neuroscience have demonstrated that unconscious mental processes are intelligent, adaptive, and capable of transformation.

Learning, for instance, alters synaptic connections in the brain, and this change is aided by structural codes that operate unconsciously. The learning process begins with a conscious intention, but is gradually transferred to unconscious processes, ultimately becoming a rich, generative activity governed by the unconscious mind.

Our unconscious is able to solve problems we are consciously aware of by drawing upon a vast repository of data across multiple neural networks, which it coordinates and analyses to produce several independent solutions simultaneously. By contrast, consciousness is narrow in scope, capable of representing only one scene at a time. This is why thousands of unconscious representations hover at the threshold of awareness, awaiting the right moment for selection. Their emergence is neither random nor chaotic, but governed by the presence of specific enabling conditions. To enter consciousness, a representation must surpass certain thresholds of intensity and duration—what scientists call the “critical threshold.” Yet despite these constraints, consciousness is more flexible than the unconscious. It can create a broad picture composed of multiple elements, whereas the unconscious operates more like a series of expert teams, each addressing a different facet of the same problem. Technically speaking, consciousness redistributes neural activity across networks active at a given moment, activating the shared processes necessary to achieve a specific objective. It then selects the most suitable unconscious solution while inhibiting the others deemed less compelling.

Modern neuroscience intersects with Freudian thought in affirming the richness of unconscious mental life—a truth substantiated by contemporary neurophysiological research. Both fields also agree that any consciously willed act originates in an unconscious mental representation, as illustrated in Benjamin Libet’s famous experiment. His findings revealed that neural encoding precedes conscious decision-making, suggesting that the act of choosing is itself shaped by prior unconscious processes.

Despite the historical divergences between neuroscience and Freudian theory, we are now witnessing a form of reconciliation between formerly opposing schools. Each holds a partial truth. Today, psychology increasingly turns to adjacent sciences—most notably neuroscience—to ground its theories in biological reality. As Henri Laborit aptly observed: “If biology is the science of life, why should we hesitate to see the human sciences as part of it? The isolation of any school of thought ultimately results in the closure of thought itself, and of the very structure of knowledge.”
