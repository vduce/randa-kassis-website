<h4>Paris and What it Means to Me — Part 2</h4>

France, in the context of the reflections above, appears to me as a sum of contradictory emotions stirred each time I utter her name. I feel lost here. Her history of struggle, which led to the downfall of monarchical tyranny and the rejection of any constraint on the freedom of the French people, gives me a certain sense of comfort—perhaps even a justification—for choosing to live here. It is a testimony to what I once believed and still do: that a human being creates her or his own destiny.

We are not born heroes or cowards. Rather, it is the path we choose and the commitments we embrace in this life that shape our fate. Mine, for a specific period, was intertwined with this country—a land that awakens all my mental and psychological energies, offering them a channel to be fulfilled and made visible. I often feel a strong urge to melt into nature, and I cannot dissociate my experiences from my genes. I am, after all, the sum total of inherited influences from my place of origin and the lived experiences that followed.

What I find most compelling about Paris is not its surface glamour, but the city’s reflection of my own infinite quest for freedom—freedom in its deeper, more essential sense, not the superficial attainment of preliminary goals. Freedom begins as a choice, but eventually becomes a commitment—an unwavering fidelity to what one has chosen, regardless of the undesirable consequences that may follow. We seek freedom for its own sake, not out of self-interest or vanity. It is this kind of freedom that propels us towards new ideas and unleashes that vital human energy—so essential to life as air is to breath.

I know Paris will not give me what I seek, for I do not believe that any city or country has ever truly managed to transcend the narrow frames that confine humanity within ethnic or national identities, or rise above the ideas tailored to serve the limited interests of its own people. Yet, at least in Paris, it remains possible for an individual—should she or he wish—to carve out a space amidst these limiting beliefs. One can still claim the right to stand by their ideas and thoughts. (Here, I mean individual liberties and the opening up of intellectual space for research and creative exploration.)

If we look closely at our existence, it becomes clear that this brief journey of life centres around the human pursuit of extending awareness to all living beings. Over millions of years, humans have refined their sensory capacities in order to move gradually beyond themselves—beyond the boundaries of their bodies and their immediate lives. The journey of humanity is a singular one, with a single aim: freedom. And freedom cannot exist without a process of emancipation from our selfish and self-centred desires, which so often hinder our evolution. Only when we elevate our sentiments to this higher plane can we receive new ideas with grace and a deeper engagement.

Freedom. I search for it in all corners of the world, in ideas and visions unchained from specific geographies or narrow identities—ideas that beckon me to delve into the essence of things, to expand across open horizons, to bridge distances, and to feel the pulse of every sentient being as though it were my own. Through understanding what lies outside of me, I come closer to understanding myself. My intellectual path is the sum of that inner self that is latent in all creatures, in all times and places.

Paris reflects the full spectrum of our human nature—its ugliness and its beauty. She attracts all races, nationalities, religions and ideologies, absorbing every psychological and sexual energy imaginable. She rejects no one, yet imposes on all a psychological pressure that often drives one to flee from her. She is like a beautiful woman—so sure of herself—that she has convinced us of her allure, imposing that image upon us as an absolute truth, even when we do not believe in absolutes. She has succeeded in brainwashing us, compelling us to see her as she wishes to be seen, stripping us of our right to question her virtues. And when we do, we are branded as ignorant of beauty, creativity, or freedom.

This city lashes us with a sadistic whip—offering fleeting pleasure but enduring pain. I have never been one for masochism; I cannot accept the treatment, nor the language and foundations Paris imposes. I have learnt to deconstruct and dismantle, to destroy the old chains and worn traditions, and from their rubble I have constructed my own language—my own standards of art, reason and creation.

But does Paris have the eternal right to usurp for herself the title of ‘City of Light’—as though a king staking claim to his throne? My answer draws upon that very term, so evocative of the Enlightenment. What is the Enlightenment, and what does it mean? According to Kant, it is the freedom to judge and reason—a clear vision of what one sees. It is the capacity of the individual to critically assess all traditions, concepts, and authorities, and to recognise the pathways that lead to sound scientific principles. It is not enough to parrot what scientists or theorists proclaim. To be enlightened, we must scrutinise everything with critical subjectivity, and any conclusions drawn must remain always open to challenge and refutation.

On these grounds, I believe it is unfair to deprive other cities—cities which have made and continue to make equally valuable contributions to humanity—of the title ‘City of Light’. Paris has long ceased to offer anything of real significance in this regard. She has become like an ageing woman, yielding to the scalpels of cosmetic surgeons in a desperate attempt to revive the allure of a long-lost youth. Today, Paris appears incapable of putting her decaying inner self to rest and being reborn anew.

Some will find this judgement harsh—many will be angered by my refusal to join those who have surrendered the keys of beauty to her. That does not concern me. I subject things to my own criteria. I dissect words, principles and concepts, building new judgements from my lived experiences, my readings, and my personal standards. I try to abstract from all nostalgic sentiment born of a vanished past. I feel it is my duty to help Paris liberate herself from the burden of her own nicknames—those very labels that prevent her from rediscovering her essence.

In the Enlightenment era, many thinkers and novelists looked to Paris as a source of inspiration, and France as a beacon of light—for she had the courage to confront tyranny. She was the muse of philosophers and poets alike. Yet that should not deter us from questioning her entitlement to retain this title indefinitely. Has not her very history taught us that human beings are at their best when they challenge established ideas? That freedom begins with thought—and thought is the measure of all things? Is not the free individual the ultimate judge of meaning, whose critical gaze reaches towards the infinite?

And is it not unjust—towards Paris herself, this city that once fought for freedom—to deny her the chance to renew her inner self by shaking off the shallow labels in which she is now imprisoned? Only then might she invent new ideas and break free from hollow, marginalising expressions. Beauty and creativity are always in flux. A being confined to superficial expressions, dependent on how others perceive him or her, is bound to decay.

Because I once loved Paris, I now wish to set her free from all titles. Perhaps then she might rediscover herself and craft new values. Perhaps then I could reunite with her again—and swim once more in the horizons of her rebellion.

Much has been said and written about Paris. I found little of it matched what I lived. Perhaps my eyes have grown too accustomed to her architecture, and so now find beauty in contrast—perhaps sight, over time, acquires the ability to detect ugliness in the beautiful and beauty in the ugly.

After all these years, I have become like a fish confined to the pristine waters of an ornamented aquarium lined with roses. And yet I yearn for the wild rivers and open seas, indifferent to their murkiness. Yes, I feel as though this city coils around me like a snake, tightening its grip upon my throat, choking my breath. That is why I leave her, time and again—for brief lapses. I do not want her to devour me whole. I am locked in a constant struggle with her aesthetics and her boundless chauvinism.

And yet, I must also admit that Paris—precisely as she is—has helped me. She taught me to subvert prevailing notions. I became an astute observer of what others take for granted. She compelled me to fragment all expressions, to reduce them to mere scattered letters, and from there she pushed me to explore the self more deeply, to reach out towards other selves. She stirred within me my long-lost feelings for living beings. She taught me how to transcend hatred and love—how to contain both at once.

She taught me, too, how to transform pain into wisdom. She taught me… and yet, I am not entirely sure what she truly taught me in the end. What I do know is that I have come to terms with her, and with myself.

I am overwhelmed by conflicting thoughts, so very like this city herself—reflected in the personality of each one of her inhabitants. She is the dazzling beauty in the eyes of the naïve, and the decadent ruin in the eyes of those who cannot see her for who she is. To some, she is a charming thief of fleeting virtues. As for me—I see her as I see myself. She is change. She is the embodiment of change. She contains every expression—beauty and ugliness, shallowness and depth—all at once. She is the sighs and cries of agony from her lovers and her torturers. She is the eternal and ever-changing beloved—forever on the run from the chains of her own captor.
