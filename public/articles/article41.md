<h4>The Flip Side of Religion</h4>

We often speak rashly of fables and myths, ridiculing their meaning and principles as relics of a bygone era. Yet what many fail to recognise is their omnipresence and their elusive, enduring influence. It is often difficult to grasp the extent to which they are embedded in our everyday practices and firmly held beliefs. This failure of recognition is, in part, due to the silent absorption of myths and fables into religion, where they have been preserved, nurtured, and reinvented as divine miracles.

That said, the vital role myths and fables played in the evolution and development of numerous civilisations must not be overlooked or dismissed. Myths were essential to the formation of civic values that enabled the smooth functioning of daily life. They helped instil respect for private property and shaped the organisation of society—from the family unit to larger social structures. Fables served as powerful tools that strengthened individuals’ adherence to societal norms, even though this process has undoubtedly claimed countless innocent lives throughout history. Fables evolved into myths, taboos, and prohibitions, which gradually coalesced into religions. These, in turn, gave rise to the concept of God—its most fertile breeding ground.

In time, gods and their laws adapted to the customs and traditions of the societies that embraced them. For example, the Roman adoption of Christianity involved a reinterpretation of pagan festivals. What is now celebrated as the birth of Christ was originally a Roman feast marking the birth of the sun. It was only later that the Church designated the same date to commemorate Christ’s nativity. Similarly, Easter rituals echo the death and resurrection of the Phoenician deity Adonis. Numerous parallels can be drawn between Christian traditions and earlier pagan religions.

The image I would like to focus on at this stage of analysis is the myth of the virgin birth in Christianity. Similar narratives can be found in the ancient civilisations of Egypt, Greece, and India. They also appear among tribal societies where sexual intercourse was not yet directly linked to human reproduction. Tribes practising totemic beliefs established kinship ties between themselves and various forms of life, especially animals and plants. It was widely believed that when a woman gave birth and endured labour pains, she had to recall what she had seen, eaten, or thought about before going into labour. A connection was thus made between the event of birth and a particular plant or animal, with the newborn assigned the corresponding totem. As explained by the anthropologist James Frazer, primitive myths lay at the foundation of totemic religions. So although the notion of a virgin birth appeared among many tribes, it gained a sacred, mysterious dimension in the spiritual context of the Virgin Mother.

Fables and myths are not the exclusive domain of any one religion; rather, they form a shared basis for all religions. I have chosen to begin with the relationship between Christianity and pagan mythology to avoid provoking the oversensitivity of Muslim cultures or being accused of antisemitism had I begun with the myths underlying Judaism. I considered it safer to draw on Christianity—a religion that no longer wields political or judicial power. Moreover, the majority of Christian believers would likely not take offence at the above critique of the parallels between myth and religious tradition.

It is important to recognise that the laws and rituals of all religions are borrowed from pre-existing beliefs. It is virtually impossible for a religion to completely erase the beliefs already held by its converts. That is why every religion inhabits older forms of faith. It is not simply built atop existing cultural and moral systems, but is closely connected to them, preserving and reproducing them in new forms within a unified religious discourse. Religion emerges through this subtle and intricate historical process and is further shaped by environmental and climatic conditions throughout its expansion. According to Will Durant, religion reinforces moral law in two primary ways: through myths and through taboos. Myths nurture belief in supernatural and metaphysical forces. Traces of ancient or pagan beliefs can be found in every new law and article of faith across cultures and societies. These foundations become more evident when we examine the early and primitive beginnings of religion.

Returning to fables and to the real and symbolic sacrifices once made to appease spirits thought to govern the natural world: power was eventually transferred to a supreme deity. This divine omnipotence remains with us today, deeply ingrained in modern consciousness. Sacrifices are still performed in the name of a widely venerated deity, exalted by worshippers as the Almighty.

Primitive humans were crippled by fear of the natural phenomena they could not comprehend. In their inability to control or understand such forces, they began to worship them. Hoping to appease what they could not explain, they offered sacrifices at its altar. Over time, this incomprehensible and wrathful nature was deified. Every society developed its own conception of this god. In some Mexican tribes, the Aztecs executed ritual sacrifices by killing selected individuals believed to embody the divine. The victims were skinned alive in a ritual thought to grant eternal youth and everlasting life. For them, death was the gateway to eternity.

Human history is marked by a tireless pursuit of eternity and a refusal to accept death. This is perhaps best symbolised by the biblical figures of Adam and Eve, whose endless and incomplete journey towards knowledge serves to confront the universal fear of mortality. Once granted eternal life, they lost it for having disobeyed their creator in their quest for knowledge—thus, death became their punishment. This universal tale, echoed in various local traditions, is the symptom of a deity fabricated by humankind. This man-made god, in essence, seeks nothing but obedience—an enslaved following, easily exploited and controlled by his earthly representatives.

Deep down, humans have always known they possess the power to dismantle this deity and all his accompanying myths and fables. But to do so would also mean confronting the end of the dream of eternity, a vision that first appeared in the minds of early humans at the dawn of history. The notion of death was always an intolerable one, prompting the invention of countless strategies to defy its finality—from magic and shamanism to taboos and prohibitions. These systems aimed to delay the spirit’s departure from the body or to imagine its return in another life. Humankind’s failure to create eternity led it to project its deepest desires onto external forces embodied in nature. Thus were born extraordinary, mysterious powers, which evolved into increasingly complex forms. Onto these creations, the human mind projected its repressed instincts—those censured by the community—and transformed them into paradises and afterlives filled with all that was forbidden in this life: rivers of wine, honey, and milk, and endless legions of virgins awaiting the believer beyond the veil of death.

What is most striking about this blurred transition from the concept of death to that of God is the uncritical acceptance by vast swathes of humanity of religious myths. We might understand how primitive societies were bound by the spirits of their ancestors and the traditions of their unlettered environments. It is difficult for any individual to sever ties with such deeply rooted customs. What truly confounds the mind, however, is the condition of modern societies—entire populations blindly aligning themselves with religious myths, rallying behind impotent leaders who offer them nothing of substance. Have we not wronged ourselves by embracing monotheistic religions and, in doing so, reconfiguring our thinking into a monotheistic, totalitarian mindset—one god, one idea, one leader?
