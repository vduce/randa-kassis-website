<i>The Arab Spring: The Formation of Consciousness and the Clash Between the Self and Repression</i>

What came to be known as the “Arab Spring” – as many prefer to call it – was the result of a complex accumulation of factors over decades. This reinforces the belief that it was not a spontaneous eruption but rather the outcome of psychological and social tensions, intensified by external stimuli that compelled millions to release their repressed internal frustrations. This release began gradually, eventually evolving into revolutions that toppled entrenched regimes plagued by corruption and authoritarianism. Each phase of this so-called “Spring” revealed its distinct manifestations of upheaval.

Excessive repression by authoritarian regimes played a decisive role in activating the collective unconscious, which instinctively sought outlets to release the growing pressure, especially under the constraints on freedom of expression. In a bid to maintain power, some regimes in Arab-Islamic societies employed a calculated strategy by instrumentalising fundamentalist religion. They played a double game-on one hand, feigning secularism by attacking religious-based political parties, while on the other, fuelling extremism and undermining individual awareness.

The religious foundation of Arab societies, which often restricts individuals within a value system at odds with human psychological needs, made it easier for these regimes to dominate. Religion, rather than acting as a source of transcendence, became a refuge for those escaping their own realities and a world that denied their essential needs. This fusion of religion and authoritarian rule eroded national identity, particularly given that religion is inherently transnational, and religiosity does not necessarily uphold patriotism.

These regimes also co-opted nationalistic discourse, donning patriotism as a mask in a masquerade of despotism. The repetitive use of nationalist slogans led-especially among younger generations-to an unconscious aversion, stripping the language of its genuine substance.

In this vacuum, hard-line Islam-detached from the collective historical memory-began permeating the social fabric of certain communities. Islamist movements exploited a deep-rooted sense of defeat, offering a religious identity to individuals confined within cultural and ethical-religious structures resistant to change. Through this identity, they found a semblance of security and a psychological substitute for unmet desires.

Modern communication technologies, of course, played a major role in facilitating the exchange of information, creating fertile ground for rebellion against tyranny. However, information is the foundation of knowledge-not knowledge itself. It contributes to the formation of mental representations, both consciously and subconsciously, through sensory inputs. Once external conditions permit, the subconscious pushes these representations to the surface.

If we examine the subconscious preparatory stages leading to the uprisings, we find a latent rejection of harsh realities and a constant search for release. The subconscious seeks ways to alleviate pressure, and when suitable conditions arise, this subconscious state transitions into conscious awareness. Given that many individuals in these societies share similar suffering, this awareness often evolves into a collective demand for radical change.

It must be emphasised that repression-be it political, social, or religious-is a core driver in prompting the mind to seek expression. Other factors, such as economic decline, also played a role by sealing off the final outlets for release, creating a societal pressure cooker. This was particularly true after Western countries closed off migration routes.

In such conditions, Islamist movements-better organised than their secular or liberal counterparts-quickly filled the political and cultural vacuum left behind. Although they gained momentum, their ability to sustain long-term governance remained questionable, as their structure mirrored that of the repressive regimes they opposed, particularly in their approach to censorship and control. More importantly, these movements remained trapped in a past era, disconnected from contemporary realities. Egypt is perhaps the clearest example of political Islam’s dwindling support base.

<i>Syria: The Complexity of the Uprising and Shifting Realities</i>

Among all Arab uprisings, the Syrian case emerged as the most complex, for a multitude of intertwined reasons. What began as calls for reform quickly met with violent repression, causing the demands to escalate into calls for regime change and the removal of President Bashar al-Assad.

At that time, Western powers-chiefly France, Britain, and the United States-appeared to adopt firm rhetoric, making statements such as “Assad must step down” and declaring the regime illegitimate. Ambassadors were recalled, and diplomatic ties severed, leading many to believe that military intervention was imminent. Yet, nothing of the sort materialised.

Despite the heavy toll of the Syrian uprising, it failed to garner the trust of the country’s minorities. This stemmed from deep-seated mistrust among Syria’s social groups, disillusionment with the prospects of democratic transformation, and an absence of concrete guarantees for the protection of minority interests.

The Syrian opposition-whether the National Council or the later National Coalition-proved unable to offer meaningful reassurances. It failed to understand the legitimate fears of minorities, who were concerned about being marginalised in any post-regime future. Most opposition leaders lacked a true culture of diversity, viewing minorities through the lens of tolerance rather than equal partnership. While they repeated phrases such as “respecting all communities,” their rhetoric lacked substance.

This shortcoming coincided with the rise of political Islam and the infiltration of jihadist groups, many of which targeted specific sects. This confirmed the regime’s narrative, which from the outset warned of extremist threats to minorities, using such claims to justify its brutal crackdown.

The regime capitalised on this chaos, presenting itself as the defender of minorities and benefiting from its long experience in exploiting the opposition’s errors. The spread of jihadist movements, in particular, gave the regime a pretext to consolidate its control.

Meanwhile, opposition groups focused on securing legitimacy from foreign sponsors, neglecting the crucial task of engaging Syria’s minorities-who constitute between 35% and 40% of the population. The mere inclusion of a few minority figures in opposition structures failed to create a genuine sense of representation.

Thus, the minority issue became a central part of the solution-but its neglect deepened the crisis and transformed the conflict into a protracted bloodbath.

Beyond the issue of minorities, many opposition figures remained incapable of formulating a realistic discourse aligned with national and international interests. Their language was emotional, reliant on slogans, lacking the experiential grounding required to grasp the ethical and political complexities of the Syrian conflict.

From a psychological and anthropological perspective, morality emerges from individual interactions with the environment. Moral systems evolve based on psychological needs and collective interests. As Schopenhauer suggested, morality often stems from individual egoism filtered through social adaptation.

Societies built on perpetual tension generate individuals unable to adapt to changing conditions. This explains why some opposition factions reduced the conflict to simplistic binaries-good versus evil, right versus wrong. They lacked strategic vision and remained confined by emotional responses, bound to shallow assumptions incompatible with Syria’s multifaceted reality.

<i>The International Dimension: Hesitation and the Weight of Calculations</i>

Two crucial questions posed by Russia remain unanswered by the United States:

– Who is the viable alternative to the current regime-capable of governing, safeguarding international interests, and maintaining control in Syria?
– If Assad agrees to step down, where would he and his leadership go? And what happens to their assets? No country will finance their exile.

To date, no American team with adequate experience has emerged to manage the complexities of the Syrian file. U.S. policymakers appear to have internalised the opposition’s slogans, echoing them in a superficial attempt to promote certain figures and structures.

This lack of coherence is not unique to Washington. France and Britain have similarly faltered. Despite pushing for the lifting of the arms embargo on opposition groups, they hesitated to implement it, due to disagreements over potential consequences.

Many Western actors remain opposed to arming the opposition for several reasons:

• The absence of a clear mechanism to distribute weapons safely, amid concerns that arms might fall into jihadist hands-with over 800 European jihadists reportedly active in Syria.
• Fears that such actions would be seen as a strategic challenge to Russia, prompting it to escalate arms transfers to the regime and intensify the conflict.

• The lack of a credible political alternative, reinforcing Russia’s insistence on a political settlement that maintains its influence in the region.

Russia views negotiation as an integral part of warfare. A comprehensive settlement requires the inclusion of all major stakeholders. American insistence on presenting the fragmented “Coalition” as the sole representative at the Geneva II conference clashed with Moscow’s position.

A lasting solution cannot be reached without engaging moderate voices capable of articulating pragmatic demands and safeguarding the interests of all segments of society. Syria’s pluralism must be acknowledged and reflected in any viable settlement. The illusion of majority rule, if misapplied, risks dismantling the very unity it seeks to preserve.

<i>Towards a Comprehensive Settlement: The Heart of the Matter Lies Within</i>

While international consensus is essential, internal reconciliation is even more pressing. Ending the bloodshed demands the inclusion of all political forces and social groups in Syria. A serious dialogue must begin-one that addresses the root causes of the crisis, not just its symptoms.

Syria’s tragedy is not simply a power struggle; it is a crisis of identity, statehood, and social cohesion. Ignoring these elements has driven the country deeper into conflict. Experience has shown that exclusion, regardless of its source, only breeds extremism.

The United States and other influential powers must ease their insistence on the Coalition as the sole representative and open the door to a more inclusive framework. It is illogical to impose a fragmented body at the negotiating table while it fails to reflect the reality on the ground.

The path to resolution lies in empowering moderate voices capable of articulating shared interests and identifying common ground. Recognising Syria’s diverse social makeup is essential; a distorted reading of majority rule can destroy both national aspirations and the hopes of those it claims to represent.

Ultimately, emotional rhetoric must give way to pragmatic realism. History does not honour slogans-it remembers only what brings real change. That change is born not of idealism, but of the courage to confront reality and shape it from within, with resolve and responsibility.
