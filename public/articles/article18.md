<h4>Bouazizi’s Revolt: The Birth of a New Life Project</h4>

Mohamed Bouazizi’s spontaneous act of defiance against the degrading conditions in his society—and the wave of strikes and protests it ignited across Tunisia—marks a defining moment. It reminds us that, at times, death can become the threshold for a new beginning: the inception of a life project born out of rupture.

What is unfolding in Tunisia today is not merely a reaction—it is the first glimmer of consciousness after a long coma. A lucid recognition of deprivation, and a deliberate choice to resist in pursuit of dignity, fulfilment, and sufficiency. It is the awakening of a society long resigned to silence.

Bouazizi’s case is not an anomaly. It reflects a collective condition endured by countless young men and women across the Arab world. It is the paralysis that comes with powerlessness, the erosion of even the most basic individual freedoms under regimes that know only the language of domination—where life and death are weaponised in equal measure.

When freedom becomes intertwined with death, when the homeland begins to resemble an earthly hell—a vision not far removed from the believer’s imagined inferno—it becomes clear that life has ceased to be long before any true journey of exploration or meaning could begin. And it is precisely that journey—towards meaning—that fuels life.

Many of us cling to life despite its misery, accepting subjugation, self-effacement, and withdrawal. Our demands are reduced to satisfying the most primal needs, and the individual becomes trapped in a condition lower than that of animals—who, at the very least, live in harmony with nature. This compels us to re-evaluate the foundational meaning of life. Perhaps, then, we might rise—if only marginally—to the level of creatures that live with balance and instinctual coherence.

For centuries, humanity has wrestled with the fear of death by constructing fantasies of an illusory eternity, forgetting to harness its inner forces to seek fulfilment in this life. In this process, earthly life was replaced by the promise of eternal life—a compensatory illusion. And just as one approaches fulfilment and begins to acquire greater freedom, they retreat into this illusion, surrendering instead to the comfort of death.

It is from here that we must examine the state of the individual in Arab societies, crushed beneath the weight of an unholy trinity: a wrathful God, a tyrannical ruler, and a repressive society. The suffering of individuals in such contexts mirrors, in many ways, the believers’ vision of hell. So we are right to ask: what does life mean for those who are denied its very pleasures?

I remain convinced that life and freedom are inextricably bound. They converge at the point of knowledge, the freedom to choose, and the acceptance of responsibility. While our awareness is often shaped by the values imposed by our environment, we retain the capacity to derive new ideas from diverse sources—ideas that allow us to choose, reject, or transform prevailing norms. From such autonomy, genuine responsibility emerges.

This autonomy, however, can only be born from an individual process of fulfilment—beginning with the satisfaction of primal needs, and gradually evolving within a social framework that offers rewards to encourage the individual’s participation and integration.

It is these rewards that compel individuals to embrace collective values, work to perpetuate them, and even sacrifice in their name. But when such rewards vanish, so too do the meanings and values the collective once instilled. Without them, life loses coherence—especially when the collective exercises total control, extinguishing the last refuge of individuality: the imagination.

At this point, the individual loses all internal motivation to pursue fulfilment or sufficiency. As Henri Laborit observed, 'Satisfaction can only be attained through an act of fulfilment. When fulfilment becomes impossible, crisis ensues—manifesting as violence when it affects an individual, or as revolution when it affects a broader class'.

For this reason, I believe it is legitimate—indeed essential—to re-examine the meaning of life and death within Arab societies, where even the right to meet one’s basic needs is absent. Can life be defended when its primary engine—desire, drive, fulfilment—has been severed?

To my mind, what separates life from death is precisely the awareness of both—and of freedom. Life, without fragments of freedom, becomes void. It is the consciousness of one’s condition, and the freedom to choose a path towards fulfilment, that give life its worth.

This is why, in some circumstances, suicide aligns more closely with the principle of life than with its negation—especially when it emerges under the weight of authoritarianism, ideological suffocation, or a religious order that throttles human fulfilment. In such contexts, choosing death becomes an act of rebirth—for others—and a moment of clarity and liberation for the individual.

It is well known that the collective invented the illusion of security to draw the individual into its fold. It has also devised countless mechanisms—varying from society to society—depending on how much freedom it permits. The collective will always innovate new tools to preserve its dominance, for every social system is ultimately a closed system, circulating information and values within its own orbit.

Yet we must understand the primary driving force behind these systems: fulfilment first, then the hope of sufficiency, both arranged within a rigid hierarchy. When both are absent, the individual remains trapped in a state of perpetual torment, suspended between life and death.

This is the condition of all individuals living under authoritarianism in its various forms across the Arab world. And that is why we must honour every act—whether personal or collective—that seeks liberation, even if we disagree with the methods employed.
