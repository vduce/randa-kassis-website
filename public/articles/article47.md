<h4>The Fourth Order of Racism</h4>

Over the ages, humankind has endured various forms of self-inflicted violence and oppression. With the gradual establishment of principles promoting social justice and equality, this age-old tendency towards violence and self-destruction has been tempered—but not entirely overcome. Narrow self-interest still animates the ego, driving individuals to cling to racist doctrines and acts of discrimination.

Racist attitudes can often be understood as sublimated frustrations of individuals no longer capable of innovation or creativity. They conveniently find fertile ground in unimaginative and unoriginal minds. When individuals or small groups fall back on explicit or unspoken racist doctrines to justify their supposed moral superiority, they devote much of their time and energy to fabricating excuses for subjugating and persecuting others—be they individuals, ethnic groups, or other social formations cast into the role of ‘the other’.

Looking broadly at the unfolding of this vast human drama throughout history, one is left with a powerful conclusion: that humanity’s intellectual evolution, and its gradual move towards a deeper understanding of human nature, only became possible when consciousness and perception extended beyond the narrow confines of the ego.

Humankind has fought—and continues to fight—racism in all its varied shapes and forms. At times it targets skin colour, at others religious belief, or even a specific gender.

However, what tends to be forgotten—or rather, not openly discussed—are those other forms of racism that rarely meet with condemnation or scrutiny. Despite the rising tide of human empathy and the ideal of fraternity, we often fall short of our humanity, even while boasting of our greatness. The ego remains a wall between humankind and its own human essence—between the species and that which makes it truly human.

In principle, what defines humanity is its grounding in a dual consciousness: one that turns inward to engage with internal psychological states, and another that reaches outward towards the surrounding physical world. This balanced dual movement enables us to seek a way of life that harmoniously accommodates and coexists with diverse individuals and cultures. This is our true responsibility—towards our own humanity, and towards all living beings.

Despite the great strides humankind has made—from the dark ages of ignorance to an era of enlightenment—we have not managed to overcome the primitive anxiety buried deep within our collective psyche. This anxiety is sublimated in practices where individuals or groups enslave animals or other human beings. This primal urge to dominate and exert power over others destroys the very notion of free will and choice.

Those who justify the slaughter of animals as necessary for nourishment should consider recent health research indicating that a vegetarian diet is the most suitable for the human body. Such primitive and unreflective behaviours are driven by entrenched habits that govern our treatment of the unfamiliar or the different. As a result, our ability to open our minds to more evolved levels of perception is lost. These behaviours may be rooted in distant ancestral memories—false victories over anxiety gained through dominance over other life forms.

Early humans had limited means to survive in a hostile natural environment. They killed one another out of competition for scarce resources. But with the passage of time and the invention of agriculture, humankind embarked on a long journey towards higher consciousness—culminating in civilisations where life offered more options than those dictated by sheer necessity. And yet, some people still cling to primitive, racist practices and beliefs—perhaps in a desperate attempt to fill the bottomless void that exists within their minds.

All the arguments and justifications presented to uphold systems of distinction and discrimination must be continually refuted. Whatever the target of discrimination, the underlying principle remains the same: to deny the other’s right to life and dignity on the grounds of perceived worthlessness. These excuses used to legitimise racist violence are symptoms of narrowed perception and an inability to engage with that which we do not understand.

Discrimination and racism have often been justified by alleged inequalities in intellectual or creative capacity. Have women not, throughout the ages, been treated as lesser beings and relegated to the status of second-class citizens? Has anti-Semitism not been rationalised by the vile claim that Jews are a cursed people, unworthy of life? Have not all religions, in one way or another, resorted to discrimination by promoting the notion of a chosen people and denying equality to all in the eyes of God?

Through the power of reason and intellect, humankind has risen above many of these primitive beliefs and condemned racist practices. Yet, despite this progress, we consistently fail to take seriously the discrimination committed against animals. As Isaac Bashevis Singer once wrote, “In relation to them, all people are Nazis; for the animals, it is an eternal Treblinka.”

Take a moment to look at the meat dishes we consume daily. What is so appetising about this barbaric spectacle, which should instead serve as a reminder of our cruelty towards animals? As Tolstoy observed: “By killing, man suppresses in himself, unnecessarily, the highest spiritual capacity—that of sympathy and pity towards living creatures like himself—and by violating his own feelings becomes cruel.” If we have turned our bodies and stomachs into graveyards for dead animals, how can we expect to build a better future?

To this day, many individuals and cultures continue to accept the routine slaughter of animals. They confine the value of life to human beings alone, believing that only human consciousness is capable of fostering progress. But life is not the sole preserve of humankind—it exists in all living creatures. And if we deny animals the right to live because they offer no contribution to human advancement, should we not then also eliminate all human beings who fail to contribute? Not every human adds something to the future of our species—but does that mean they do not deserve to live?

A genuine vision of human progress must be rooted in sympathy for the other—whether that other is human or another form of life. This very sentiment of sympathy led us to protect the environment once we became fully aware of its vital role in sustaining life. There is a clear connection between our excessive consumption of animal meat and the destruction of the natural world.

A brief glance at reports from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization reveals the catastrophic impact of livestock production, now one of the foremost contributors to environmental degradation and climate change.

David Molden, coordinator of the Comprehensive Assessment of Water Management in Agriculture and deputy research director at the International Water Management Institute, reported to the FAO that “meat consumption is one of the major causes of pollution. The transportation of products to feed livestock is responsible for 2.4 billion tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions each year.” He also highlighted the enormous quantities of water and produce consumed by animals raised for human consumption—between 5,000 and 25,000 litres of water are needed to produce just one kilogram of animal protein, compared with only 10 litres for the same amount of vegetable protein.

Wealthy nations buy, on average, 80% of their livestock feed from poorer countries, many of which suffer from extreme malnutrition. Brazil, for instance, exports 70% of its agricultural production to rich countries—an amount that could instead feed its own hungry population. Economist Jeremy Rifkin estimates that the world’s crop production used to feed livestock—approximately 670 million tonnes—could nourish 850 million people suffering from hunger.

All of this should compel us to reflect seriously on our dietary habits. For every piece of animal protein consumed, nine times that amount of vegetable protein is denied to someone else.
