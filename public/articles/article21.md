<h4>Where Does Arab Culture Stand in Relation to Secularism?</h4>

From time to time, proposals resurface affirming the inevitability of secularism within Arab societies. These are swiftly met with louder and more numerous voices from opposing religious factions, accompanied by cries of denunciation from within the public sphere, protesting what they perceive as a grand conspiracy that has been meticulously woven for centuries against their communities.

We clearly observe, with some consistency, the inflamed glorification prevalent among individuals in these groups, expressed through a repeated vocabulary grounded in fantastical beliefs-chief among them the notion that the entire world conspires against their lands. And why wouldn’t they believe so, when they consider themselves the chosen children of heaven, uniquely selected above all others? This condition bears resemblance to that of a patient crushed by his environment, who, under mounting pressure, resorts to chronic hallucinations in an effort to compensate for what he lacks.

It reflects a deep insufficiency experienced by the individual across all dimensions, and a severe sense of obliteration before the collective structure-be it religious authority, familial bonds, or traditional power. As a result, we often see individuals repeating, almost mechanically, the terminology deeply implanted in their consciousness by the group to which they belong.

For this reason, I believe we must cease the repetitive invocation of the term “secularism”, as it triggers states of panic and dread among members of these collectives. Rather, I find it necessary to briefly revisit history, in the hope of extracting useful lessons from the experiences of those who came before us-lessons that might help us conserve our energy instead of squandering it on repetition, and direct it instead towards finding solutions to the tragic reality facing the individual and, subsequently, the community. This may be achieved by avoiding terminology charged with repugnant emotional connotations, for our collectives are in urgent need of prolonged psychological therapy-therapy capable of dismantling the internal barriers and relieving the chronic rigidity they suffer from, in order to cultivate a capacity for intellectual flexibility.

Let us take a historical view of change within societal structures. We would find that new laws and systems, in any given society, are almost always rooted in its own cultural and historical context. Even the most revolutionary legislations carry a conservative element-a thread that binds them to the fabric of the collective. Therefore, researchers and those concerned with improving their societies must first study, in depth, the consciousness of their people, so that they may learn how to touch the emotional core of the individual and carry them towards a promised future.

And perhaps, before calling for a specific system or structure, there is a prior need to develop new concepts and frameworks that may gradually circulate among the population. These, in turn, may one day provide the foundation for a coherent system or law under which the society can unite.

Returning to the rejection of the word “secularism”, I would argue that the issue lies in the concept itself. Before we engage with it in a superficial manner, we must acknowledge that secularism is not a fixed definition. Its essence lies in its mutability, its adaptability to the transformations of life. The insistence of some on assigning it a single, static meaning exposes us to another problem: the authoritarianism of epistemological ego. Before demanding the implementation of any institutional system, individuals within these collectives must first learn how to swim in the depths of language, to navigate freely across its meanings and dimensions.

Before embarking on a brief historical overview of secularism, allow me a simple question: what is the purpose of fabricating a collective formula so rigid and immobile? Would that not amount to reproducing religious dogma in the form of equivalent civil legislation?

Has secularism in France, for example, remained true to the original principles it established during the French Revolution? Evidently not. These principles have evolved gradually from the eighteenth century up to the early twentieth. Secularism began with basic premises rooted in equal rights for individuals, which slowly spread to encompass the very structure of the state. This culminated in the 1905 law on the separation of church and state.

It is important to note, however, that French secularism in 1905 differs in several respects from its present-day form. Today, secularism manifests more assertively in French society’s rejection of all religious symbols-not solely Islamic, but those of all faiths. We must also realise that secularism will never settle into a final form. It is a perpetually shifting phenomenon, anchored in the fundamental principle of freedom of thought and expression.

Secularism still has a long road ahead in its pursuit of broader individual freedoms, in helping people liberate themselves from all forms of enslavement. Enslavement is not confined to the domain of deity or religion; it extends to the realm of consumerism, to repetitive, uninspired labour devoid of intellectual engagement. It is this that fuels the diminished self-an ego trapped beneath the authority of servitude.

We need not argue over the term or the label that facilitates meaningful change, as long as it ultimately serves the individual and strikes a balance between their needs and those of their collective. Thus, we must continue our search for a new concept to serve this aim. We must transcend the enslavement of vocabulary, and exercise creativity to reach the emotional and religious affiliations of the group. We must seek to subtly transform emotions themselves, through diverse and intelligent methods, rather than casting people directly into the arms of what they perceive as the enemy of life.

We cannot transplant the cultural outcomes of societies vastly different from ours-whether in their religious, political, or economic evolution-and apply them mechanically to our own. What we can do is study and analyse these movements in order to extract the core principles that governed their transformative journeys. From this point, imagination can be unleashed, and creativity can flourish.

I believe that the current sectarian fragmentation within our societies provides fertile ground for transformation. This change will not emerge from unity or mutual understanding between sects, but from their very divisions and disorientation. These conditions are the driving force behind the formation of neutral concepts and legislative frameworks capable of guaranteeing individual freedoms.

Islam was never the solution. Nor was Christianity. Nor will any rigid legal system ever be. Secularism emerged, in fact, from internal church conflicts, from the desire of some to break free from papal authority in favour of monarchs or emperors. Social, political, and other structural factors joined forces to give rise to the change.

Let us not forget that the freedoms Europe now enjoys came at the cost of the bodies of its people. As the anthropologist Frazer noted in his study of so-called “savage” societies: the strength of any group lies in the ability of its members to sacrifice the present for a future capable of fulfilling them-and the same is true of the individual.

I did not write this piece out of firm belief in the necessity of individual sacrifice for the group. Perhaps it is because I no longer subscribe to the modern forms of human affiliation-nationhood, homeland, even humanity itself. My allegiance is to life, and to what life embodies in all living beings. Yet I am aware that the flourishing of any collective group must follow that logic.

Ultimately, I believe that the beginning of any true transformation lies in freeing ourselves from the tyranny of rigid language, and in abandoning the blind imitation of history. The circumstances that enabled other nations to overcome their authoritarian past and join the flow of life differ drastically-geographically and historically-from those of our own. Perhaps the time has come to stir our psychological responses by inventing new expressions and linguistic structures that are in harmony with the religious and historical texture of our societies.

Those who fail to create, to think, to move in step with life’s unfolding momentum, will simply vanish. History-and anthropology-have taught us that life is rooted in evolution; it selects only those elements capable of adapting to its unrelenting transformations.

Perhaps it is time for these societies to realise that their fate is extinction if they persist in clinging to static absolutes that conflict with nature’s own order. After all of this, I am left with one final question: what is the true source of this chronic rigidity that governs the fate of these peoples? Might it be an unconscious yearning for immortality at the side of their god? And why not, when they were raised to revere both servitude and death in equal measure?

Perhaps the time has come to reconstruct global concepts, to propose new forms of belonging-free of nation, ethnicity, and inherited identity. Perhaps we should support those who wish to fulfil their fantastical desire for suicide and aid them in their journey to be reunited with their deity. Let them choose death if they wish.

As for us: You may keep your dead god. We shall embrace our ever-changing life.
