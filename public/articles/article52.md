<h4>The “Group” Effect</h4>

From the moment he is born, the Arab citizen remains bound to his destiny and to the society in which he places an unquestioned and absolute faith. As a result, he rejects the psychological evolution that challenges him, depriving himself of the ability to be open to external ideas. In doing so, he cuts himself off from self-discovery and from becoming part of a greater whole.

This society resists progress; it also rejects the emancipation of the individual from the collective. It stands as a barrier to personal freedom, suppressing any attempt at rebellion or deviation. No matter how determined or persistent the effort, the drive for emancipation is consistently stifled. This suppression eventually manifests as a kind of psychological disturbance, disrupting the balance between the outward flow of thoughts and a retreat into the depths of imagination.

The Arab individual becomes imprisoned by illusions and ideas imposed by the collective. He subjugates himself to societal rules and the will of its leaders, paving the way for the destruction of his own personal desires.

From a psychoanalytic perspective, Jung considered the libido to be the source of a man’s deepest aspirations, while Freud viewed it as the seat of arousal—essentially, the foundation of psychological equilibrium. Any dysfunction in this area inevitably has repercussions for humanity as a whole. Just as libido is the gravitational centre of the individual, so too is the individual the core of society. Any imbalance at the personal level is bound to reverberate throughout the collective.

With individual submission comes a drift from realistic solutions—those which enable societies to evolve. Herein lies the glaring contradiction that haunts the Arab citizen: the dissonance between practical realities and the fantasies that serve unconscious desires, all compounded by external pressures.

This persona replicates itself among individuals through the subconscious. As Jung observed, individual consciousness is the most elusive aspect of the self, defined by the unique traits of each person—traits that can differ widely. In contrast, the unconscious is a shared foundation that connects individuals to their people and their history.

A society draws its originality and creativity from its members. In many cultures, individuality is nurtured and safeguarded, with the understanding that it can produce positive outcomes. Individuals belong to the collective while still preserving their personal traits.

In Arab societies, the opposite often occurs: the collective destroys any sign of individuality, seeking instead to display a single, unified “face” in which everyone becomes interchangeable. The mass becomes the one, and the one becomes the mass. Individuals are no longer unique contributors to a whole but rather replaceable fragments of it.

The Arab “mass” proves largely incapable of renewing its image, clinging instead to uniformity at all costs—leading ultimately to the repression of the self. It is from this condition that the constant search for a saviour, or for God, emerges—along with the hope of a brighter afterlife to make sense of present constraints.
