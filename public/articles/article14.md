<h4>Political Islam and Ideology: Two Faces of Tyranny</h4>

At a time when popular uprisings across the Arab world intensify in their call for freedom, social justice, and an end to the tyranny and exploitation practised by authoritarian regimes, we are confronted with a striking contradiction in how different movements and ideologies understand the very notion of freedom. Among these, political Islam presents itself as the most fitting project for societies where the majority profess the Islamic faith. Yet in doing so, it excludes all who do not share its beliefs or vision—advancing a narrow political framework that, in essence, mirrors the same authoritarianism it claims to oppose.

To realise its project, political Islam begins with the Islamisation of everyday life—seeking to permeate all aspects of social and personal existence. It aims to subjugate the individual through the imposition of rules and norms set by those who call themselves scholars of Islam. In this vision, the individual is not recognised as an autonomous being but merely as a component of the collective. Individual beliefs and freedoms are acceptable only if they conform to the prescribed religious framework. Simply put, there is no freedom outside the sacred texts.

As for justice and equality, they are not extended to non-Muslims—whether they are of Muslim origin but have chosen a different worldview, or whether they belong to other faiths altogether. Political Islam divides the world into two spheres: that of Muslims, and that of non-Muslims, the latter of whom must be subdued and brought under the authority of the former. This binary worldview is at the core of Salafist and fundamentalist interpretations of Islam, which deny the legitimacy and rights of those who are different. Thus, the rights system promoted by political Islam is fundamentally incompatible with universal human rights.

Other ideologies, such as Arab nationalism—though now lacking a strong popular base—are equally unable to provide a theoretical framework that guarantees justice and equality among the region’s diverse ethnic groups. Their slogans often erase or marginalise distinct identities such as the Kurds, Amazigh, and others who have the full right to preserve their languages, cultural heritage, and unique ways of life.

Before we can meaningfully address the concepts of liberty and justice, we must first consider the foundations that unite individuals within a single society—a shared cultural framework that encompasses all segments of the population without discrimination. This collective culture is shaped by what might be termed a “mental universe”—a shared cognitive structure composed of symbols, principles, and mutual interests that bind people together and foster a sense of belonging.

But what exactly constitutes this “mental universe”? It consists of images, ideas, and words that circulate unconsciously in daily life. These are mental representations stored in our collective memory, absorbed from birth through external conditioning. We do not choose when these stored images appear, nor do we always control our response to them. This helps explain the automatic repetition of ideological slogans or the sudden emergence of religious zeal that can transform a tolerant believer into a militant fighting in the name of God.

Yet this is not to suggest we are powerless before these inherited mental constructs. Storing something in long-term memory and recalling it later requires, at some level, implicit consent to its content. We are capable of revisiting these representations, examining them consciously, and deciding whether to accept or reject them. However, this process is only possible within an environment that protects the individual’s right to think, speak, and criticise freely—what we might call a “free space”. This space is both external, shaped by laws and societal structures, and internal, shaped by the individual’s capacity for self-reflection and personal autonomy—provided that one’s interests do not encroach on the rights of others.

Social life is, by nature, a mixture of conflicting psychological tendencies: a desire for competition, which drives progress, and a tendency towards cooperation, which fosters social cohesion and stability. Mutual interest is thus key to survival, but interest alone is not enough. It must be paired with intelligence—the kind that produces ethical frameworks capable of ensuring justice for all, without discrimination. As the psychologist Gaston Bachelard put it, intelligence is the capacity to understand, to discover, and to innovate.

Awareness—of both our external surroundings and our internal psychological structures—is what enables us to recognise others and forge new foundations for coexistence. This depends on our ability to create shared interests among individuals and between communities. But such innovation can only occur through a deeper knowledge—one that dismantles the religious and ideological barriers that reinforce divisions.

Nationalist ideologies assert their supremacy over other ethnicities; patriotism emphasises national uniqueness; familial loyalties reinforce social stratification; and religious doctrines proclaim their own chosen status: the Muslim thanks God for the “blessing” of Islam; the Christian sees himself as a beloved child of the divine; the Jew as one chosen by God. All of these frameworks operate on the logic of distinction—claiming for themselves a moral right to dominate or marginalise others.

Such notions are wholly incompatible with the idea of free individual space and the principle of equality before the law.

Thus, we may conclude that the path to freedom begins with knowledge and awareness—concepts that stand in direct opposition to the tenets of political Islam and dominant regional ideologies. True freedom begins with an independent capacity for thought: thought unbound by inherited mental representations imposed for specific ends.

As Henri Laborit once suggested, perhaps we should replace the ideals of “freedom” and “equality” with “awareness” and “knowledge”. These are the true foundations of tolerance and dialogue—both within societies and across them.

And perhaps, one day, we will reach a broader humanist understanding that transcends geography and nationhood. Perhaps, one day, we will go even further—towards an expanded vision of humanity that recognises the right of all living beings to exist and thrive.
