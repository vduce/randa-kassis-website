We continue to chase after words, manuscripts, and myths in pursuit of a history steeped in mystery. Few things are more essential to the human condition than the thirst for knowledge. It is this yearning that prevents us from halting midway or reconciling religion with science—for science marks an evolution in human consciousness, moving beyond the early religious phases. Religions, after all, derive their texts from earlier periods shaped by magic, mana, totems, and other such frameworks. These narratives and myths, crafted by humans, often emerged from real events which were later magnified, allowing the human mind to venture into boundless realms of creativity and imagination.

Today, thanks to individuals throughout history who believed in our ability to decode riddles and challenge absolutes, the human experience continues to reshape our concepts and tools for probing the hidden layers of consciousness. In this light, the naive simplicity of early religious thought can no longer satisfy the inner thirst for understanding—particularly in an age marked by the profound achievements of science.

The presence of competing theories does not prove the existence of God, nor does it disprove scientific reasoning. Rather, it invites us to explore broader frameworks that reconcile these theories, encouraging us to delve deeper into our minds and our genes, and to uncover foundational concepts that push us forward. Our study of the past is not an exercise in nostalgia or sterile curiosity; it is a creative, searching impulse, driven by the desire to attain new knowledge and expand human self-mastery.

What we lack is faith in science—a discipline grounded in cumulative experience and rigorous experimentation. It encourages us to transcend our inner fears in order to manage our internal impulses. By contrast, the human relationship with the divine has often been rooted in psychological frailty, confining the self within a web of emotional reactivity. As Carl Jung once said: “The ordinary man needs gods and demons. The intelligent man dies his god and becomes a god himself.”

Briefly, I would like to touch on the psychological forces that gave rise to moral consciousness—a consciousness that began with individual drives and desires which were later filtered and moulded into collective moral behaviours designed to serve communal interests. The structure of these values evolved over time in response to shifting conditions, and climate too played a key role in shaping moral foundations and the evolution of culture.

Wilhelm Wundt posited that the origin of moral values and laws lies in the principle of taboo—a concept rooted in fear of nature and the unknown. Fear, he argued, was the primal source of instinct. In time, however, taboo detached from its original context and continued to exert psychological influence over individuals. Wundt also suggested that the sacred and the profane were initially a single entity during the earliest phase of taboo formation. In Greek mythology, for instance, the word daimon—commonly translated as spirit, demon, or imp—combined divine and human traits. The daimon occupied a space between the human and the divine; it was not inherently evil, but a power that transcended humanity without attaining godhood.

According to Wundt, taboo embodied both protective and demonic forces. In its earliest form, it referred to a material object or living being that could not be touched or approached—originally to safeguard the group. Over time, taboo evolved into an autonomous power that shaped behaviour and imposed a particular culture upon its members. Hence, in primitive societies, emotions of reverence and disgust accompanied it. As time passed, these two forces diverged: reverence separated from disgust, each following its own path.

But from where did these taboos derive their power?

One must recall that the unconscious mind constantly oscillates between satisfying desires and restraining them. The gratification of instinct is bound to the body and its needs. Instinctual behaviour is not learned—it is innate. Yet it evolves through experience and the learning that accompanies it. Thus, such behaviour represents a state of maturity born of the interaction between the senses and inner drives, forming an internal mechanism that links sensation, need, and motivation.

We may therefore assert that instinctual behaviour is not a product of education but a form of organised organic maturation. The continual struggle—at times to fulfil desires, at others to restrain them for the benefit of the group—helped instil basic principles that served the greater good.

Freud believed that taboo originated as an unconscious drive externalised by early humans in the form of prohibitions designed to suppress instinctual urges. The earliest and most important taboos, he argued, centred around two fundamental prohibitions tied to the totem:

1. The prohibition against killing the totemic being—be it animal or plant.

2. The prohibition of sexual relations among members of the same totem.

Freud concluded that fear is the essential engine of morality. Just as taboo represents a forbidden act, its purpose is to regulate human relations. Taboo was born from emotional conflict, and fear—driven by ignorance—transformed those emotions into a powerful force that controlled behaviour and perpetuated ignorance.

This is how fixed beliefs are born—convictions mistaken for absolute truths, though in reality they are products of internal conflicts we fail to comprehend. Thus, we lose control over ourselves and cling to illusions of eternity. We fear death because it symbolises annihilation. So began the futile human quest for a “lost soul.” I am reminded of an ancient myth in which King Midas seeks out the daimon Silenus to ask what is best for humankind. Silenus replies with a mocking laugh:

“O wretched, ephemeral creature, child of accident and pain, why do you compel me to tell you what would be better left unknown? The greatest good for you is beyond your reach—for the best fate is never to have been born. Yes, not to exist would have been your greatest fortune. But since you were born, your next best hope is to return quickly to nothingness—through an early death.”

Why, then, do we cling so tightly to the illusion of the “immortal soul”? What, precisely, prompted this belief?

Psychoanalysis suggests that humanity’s ignorance of its own dreams—and the frequent appearance of the dead within them—was enough to plant the notion of eternal souls. Prayers to the dead began out of fear, and later took on a veneer of reverence. At the root of this reverence was fear of spiritual vengeance. We see this, for example, among the warriors of the Timor Islands, who, upon returning victorious from battle, would carry the severed heads of their enemies and offer sacrifices to appease their spirits, saying: “Do not be angry with us. It could have been us in your place. Had fortune not favoured us, our heads would lie where yours now do. Accept these offerings, and let us live in peace.” They would even weep, adding: “Why were you our enemies? Could we not have remained friends, sparing your blood and your heads?”

This veneration of spirits stems from fear, not exaltation. Over time, the motivations behind prohibitions shifted. Religious commandments forbid the killing of humans but remain silent on the killing of other beings—because humans did not fear retaliation from their souls. Man reserved eternity for himself. Thus, our moral standards emerged from fear, not from any innate nobility. This is why we must return to the roots of prohibition—to understand the structure before we can begin to reform it.

This primordial fear shaped taboo. It was born of emotional conflict—between conscious pain and unconscious desire for gratification—and marked a turning point in the development of collective moral law. If we delve into the unconscious mind of primitive humans, we find they sought to store their external experiences and convert them into psychological states, which were then projected onto a hero, a leader, or a deity. These projections formed expressive symbols in the unconscious, which were later transmitted to consciousness by means of reflection.

And before concluding, I would assert that taboo is intimately tied to human awareness. It is not merely a fleeting prohibition, but a reflection of evolving collective consciousness. It was originally employed to safeguard the group and to regulate social relations, and it eventually evolved into a system with lasting psychological and cultural effects.

I now turn to the study of the prohibition of incest—one of the foundational pillars underpinning humanity’s moral architecture.

Drawing on the research of Spencer and Gillen into the emergence of the exogamous system, which developed in parallel with the totemic system, they concluded that ancient tribes divided themselves into mating groups to prevent unions between siblings. In its earliest stage, the tribe was split into two sections: one consisting of the children of the same mother, and the other comprising the rest of the men. Marriages were arranged between the two sections to limit sexual relations among siblings. As the system evolved, the tribe was later divided into four sections, then eight, in an effort to avoid close kin marriages altogether.

According to Frazer, this exogamous system gradually supplanted the earlier, more primitive totemic system, which had been based on an individualistic principle. Since paternity was often unknown, the child’s totem was believed to be determined by chance. When a woman realised she was pregnant, she would reflect on the animal or plant she had recently seen, thought of, or eaten. It was believed that this being became the child’s totem, as it was widely assumed at the time that plants and animals reproduced through human beings.

Frazer noted that the totem served as a person’s identity. Over time, however, the exogamous system—based on the division of society into marriage groups—began to replace the personal totem in some tribes, while coexisting with it in others, eventually giving rise to the concept of the collective totem. From this, we may infer that the totemic system laid the groundwork for the formation of more structured social systems.

Let us now consider Darwin’s theory regarding the social habits of higher apes, comparing them to the behaviour of early humans who lived in nomadic bands. Among these groups, jealousy—particularly among elder males—was a regulating force that governed sexual relations and limited mixing within the group. Savage suggested that humans lived in primitive communities where each man had a woman or, if strong enough, several—similar to the behaviour of gorillas, who control multiple females and guard them jealously against rival males.

Ekniston supported this view, arguing that the origin of incest taboos lies in jealousy and the desire for dominance. Over time, this psychological impulse evolved into a codified system of rules governing sexual conduct and became part of the conscious social order.

Freud and Ferenczi, meanwhile, drew upon clinical observations—particularly in cases of animal phobias among children. In their interpretation, the animal symbolised the father’s authority. From this insight, Freud developed his theory to unlock the symbolic meaning behind the totem. Building on Darwin’s ideas, he proposed that the primal father, motivated by jealousy, expelled his sons to monopolise access to women. In time, the sons returned, killed their father, and consumed his body. A struggle then broke out among them over the women, prompting a collective decision to establish boundaries, including the prohibition of incest, to preserve the integrity of the group.

Freud did not overlook the sense of guilt passed down through generations after the act of parricide and cannibalism. This inherited guilt led the group to dissociate the father’s image from the totem and to endow it with absolute authority—thereby preparing the ground for the emergence of religious structures.

The myth of the slain father recurs across Greek mythology—in the tale of Cronus, son of Gaia, who overthrew his father Uranus, or in the story of Oedipus, which would later inspire psychoanalysis in its exploration of unconscious drives and human emotion.

But do these myths reflect ancient memories embedded in our collective unconscious?

Euhemerus argued that mythological figures were originally real historical individuals who stood out in their time, and were subsequently elevated and mythologised by societies for having defied the norms of their age.

We should not dismiss any theory outright. Rather, we ought to refine certain details and search for points of convergence between seemingly opposing views—provided all theories are rooted in sound scientific reasoning, rather than in humanity’s persistent longing for self-glorification and the illusion of permanence.

In this light, I believe all scientific theories, once re-evaluated and updated, remain valid and open to further development. This is the task of each successive generation: to revisit the intellectual legacy, refine it where needed, and build upon what has come before. History is rich with language, myth, and accumulated experience—human insights that cannot be disregarded simply because we live in an age we presume to be more advanced, scientifically or ethically.

Our responsibility is not to deny the past, but to deconstruct it and reassemble it anew. Without the notions of taboo, totem, myth, and deity, we would never have reached this new threshold of awareness.

Naturally, this article does not attempt to exhaust all the theories concerning the origins of morality, nor the intersections among them. This remains the subject of an ongoing exploration in the first section of my forthcoming book. What I have provided here are preliminary insights—a framework for what is to come.

Through this anthropological and psychological lens, it becomes clear that our moral system did not arise from innate virtue or a pure internal sense of good, but rather from a complex interplay of fear, desire, and collective experience—later formalised into religious, mythological, and legal structures to regulate society and ensure its survival.

This article is not intended to offer definitive conclusions, but rather to provoke thought, raise critical questions, and encourage re-examination of the values we often accept unquestioningly. In a time saturated with ready-made truths, returning to our roots becomes a means of emancipation—not a nostalgic escape.

Understanding the origins of morality does not necessitate its wholesale rejection. Instead, it gives us the opportunity to rearticulate moral frameworks in a manner befitting our evolving consciousness—liberating ourselves from inherited norms whose origins and purposes we may no longer understand.
