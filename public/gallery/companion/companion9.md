<h4>Now, let’s talk about Tequila—the resident freak with a flair for the dramatic.</h4>  
<br/>
Tequila has a very specific hobby: freaking people out, especially her unsuspecting siblings. Approach her too confidently, and you’ll be met with a growl that says, “Think again, mate.” She keeps a strict inner circle: Mum, Dad, a few trusted carers, and the select few who’ve passed her mysterious loyalty test.

Trust with Tequila is an uphill climb. But once you’re in, you’re in for life. She’s fiercely loyal—no backstabbing, but she loves drama, especially when she wants something.

Even now, she’s the only one in the house with a seemingly inexhaustible supply of energy. Whether you’ve been gone for a few weeks, a few days, or just nipped out to the loo—her excitement upon your return lasts for hours.

Tequila believes we belong to her. And if she wants something—be it food, attention, or a change in the cosmic order—she will whinge. Not for a minute. Not for ten. But for a full hour, complete with sighs, grumbles, and the occasional dramatic stare.

Once upon a time, back in Italy, she was brilliant at agility—fast, focused, and quite possibly convinced she was auditioning for a spy film. But then came the great disruption: Covid lockdown, six months of daycare closure, and with it, a noticeable decline in her enthusiasm for showbiz. Since then, she’s declared agility “a bit passé” and has opted for a more casual approach to movement.

From time to time, we wonder whether we should have chosen different names—ones more suited to each character. But with Tequila, we got it just right. Like the drink, she hits hard, lingers long, and leaves everyone slightly dizzy but oddly charmed. No doubt about it—she earned her name. And much like her namesake, she’s not for the faint-hearted.
