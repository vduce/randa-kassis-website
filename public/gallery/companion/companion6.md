<h4>Damascius</h4>

Adopted in March 2016 – Died May 2021

Some choices in life arise not from deliberation, but from instinct—as if shaped by an unseen thread of meaning. So it was when I named an old, skeletal, ailing dog Damascius. The name seemed to emerge from nowhere, and yet, in hindsight, it could not have been more fitting.

The original Damascius, born in Damascus around 458 AD, was the last great philosopher of the Athenian Neoplatonic school. As the Christian emperor Justinian moved to extinguish the old philosophical traditions, Damascius held fast—not through open rebellion, but through quiet resistance. He remained loyal to a vision of the divine that transcended language, doctrine, and even thought itself. For him, the First Principle—what others might call God—was beyond being, beyond unity, utterly ineffable.

Our Damascius, too, resisted.

Before we adopted him in 2016, he had already learned how to avoid conflict on the streets, to stay alive without surrendering to violence. He was gravely ill when we found him: suffering from Leishmaniasis and testicular cancer. Three Greek veterinarians dismissed his chances. At most, they said, we could hope for eight to twelve months.

We began treatment nonetheless. They refused to neuter him, seeing no point in intervening. After our move to Rome, a compassionate dog trainer pointed us towards a highly skilled veterinarian who had treated wild animals in Africa. He offered a different outlook. He proposed castration as a way of halting the cancer, and we agreed.

Then came further complications: a severe infection in one eye and paw. The vet operated once again, removing the eye and two toes, carefully excising the diseased tissue. But Damascius, ever contrary to prognosis, chose life.

He lived not just a year, but five. Blind on one side, limping, and in constant treatment, he endured. More than that, he seemed to embody a quiet wisdom—a refusal to succumb, not out of fear, but from some deeper principle.

When he died in May 2021, after a slow and dignified decline, the vet estimated his age at nearly fifteen. A miracle, they said. But perhaps it was something simpler: a strong will, a deep resilience, a life lived on his own terms.

Damascius was not just our companion. He was, in his own silent and stubborn way, a philosopher. He taught us what it means to resist without anger, to endure without bitterness, and to live—not forever, but fully, while it lasts.
