<h4>Socrates</h4>

Born in May 2015, adopted (or perhaps abducted) in June 2015

Days after we landed in Greece, full of hope and illusions about a fresh start, fate threw us a cat. Our driver screeched to a halt as a scruffy kitten attempted suicide-by-traffic. Fabien and my daughter leapt out like seasoned animal rescuers, scooped him up, and brought him in. I told them to get in the car—with the creature—before someone changed their mind.

While we ate dinner like civilised people, our driver nobly took the mewling ball of fungus to the vet. Diagnosis: roughly 40 days old, ringworm on his face and paws, and a distinct air of entitlement. We got him medicated and, with time, the fungus faded—but his personality remained gloriously incurable.

We named him Socrates, in an ill-judged moment of philosophical optimism. In truth, Beria might have suited him better—a little moustache and a thirst for tyranny wouldn’t have looked out of place. When Aristotle joined us—a sweet, defenceless kitten—Socrates launched several assassination attempts. We intervened often. He was furious, perpetually offended, and allergic to companionship.

Once, in Italy, he vanished for a week. We imagined the worst—foxes, farmers, existential despair—but he eventually turned up, covered in soot and looking like he’d spent the week stuck in a chimney contemplating arson. After that episode, he decided to be indoors and has obediently tolerated every house move since, as long as he’s fed first.

Socrates is the last cat standing. When we return from trips, he howls through the night, punishing us with the relentless voice of betrayal. A feline banshee with abandonment issues.

And still, his affection manifests in the only way he knows how: biting and scratching. Apparently, love hurts. Especially from Socrates.
