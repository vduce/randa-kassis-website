<h4>I can’t speak about Clyde.</h4>
<br/>
He was adopted by a charming priest in France who, as I’ve heard, took him into the church itself. That’s all I know. Sometimes, I carry a quiet guilt for having agreed to let him be adopted by someone outside the family—someone we’ve never heard from again. There’s a part of me that wonders whether I should have kept him, kept him close, as if love were somehow guaranteed by proximity.

Still, I like to think he’s more than content. The sole companion of a priest, likely doted on without limit—no sisters to compete with, no chaos to navigate. Just one dog and one man, perhaps living side by side in calm ritual and quiet affection. Who knows—maybe he’s spoiled more than the others, cherished precisely because he is the only one. Maybe, in his own way, he’s the happiest of them all.
