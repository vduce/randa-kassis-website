<h4>Aristotle</h4>

Adopted in October 2015 – disappeared, sadly, two weeks before Bianca’s vanishing in 2021

It all began on the island of Spetses, at a seaside taverna where the air was as crisp as it was kind. There we came across a mother cat and her three kittens, lounging about as if they ran the place. One of the kittens – worryingly thin and rather unkempt – jumped onto Fabien’s lap and made himself perfectly comfortable. Strangely, he had no interest in food, which led us to wonder whether he belonged to the restaurant.

The owner explained he was a street kitten, one of the mother’s brood. A few days later, unable to forget the scruffy little fellow, we returned and decided to take him in. He was terribly ill. The local vet, never one to sugar-coat, gave us a sceptical look and not much hope. Sadly, he was right – the kitten died a week later, despite all our efforts.

We went back to the same spot on the island, hoping to help the others. The owner told us one of the remaining kittens had been spirited away by some profoundly thoughtless teenagers. Only the mother and one kitten were still there. She led us through the gate of a nearby building, and there he was – a heartbreaking sight: eyes swollen, red, infected, and reeking with illness. We took him straight to our vet. The mother, thankfully, was placed with a wonderfully kind person who adopted her.

The vet told us the kitten had a severe viral infection, common in Greece, often fatal for entire litters. But our little Aristotle – as we named him – defied the odds and survived, not only the virus but also Socrates, our other rather imperious cat.

Once in Italy, Aristotle asserted himself without hesitation, even among our dogs – including Agathe, a hunter by breed and temperament. Whether he was brave or just ever so slightly mad is still up for debate. Perhaps his neurons never quite recovered from the virus.

He was mischievous, full of life, and had a knack for winning hearts. Everyone who met him wanted to adopt him. But he was ours – undeniably, unapologetically part of our eccentric family.

And then, as life so often reminds us, joy is fleeting. He vanished – disappeared fifteen days before Bianca did, while we were away – and was never found.
