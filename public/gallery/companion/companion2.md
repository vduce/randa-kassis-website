<h4>Bianca & Roxy</h4>

**Bianca** was born in July 2012, adopted in May 2013, and disappeared—inexplicably—in July 2021.

**Roxy** was born in August 2007, adopted in June 2013, and, with his usual understated dignity, left us in June 2024.

Fabien and I decided to adopt two cats. Bianca came from someone looking for a new home for her—though, in truth, she made her own selection. Roxy had already endured three abandonments and was waiting, somewhat resignedly, in a shelter. We were warned he hated dogs. That suited me for that moment; after Nestor, I couldn’t imagine letting another dog into that space. Some absences leave room for no replacements.

Their meeting was less an introduction and more a standoff—something between a Cold War summit and a staring contest. But with time (and no other option), they settled into cohabitation. They played, occasionally. Or perhaps they simply argued with flair. Either way, we convinced ourselves it was affection–wearing a theatrical mask.

Bianca chose Fabien. Unapologetically, wholeheartedly—and very clearly not me. I was staff. She looked through me with the same expression one might reserve for a broken Hoover. She, however, adored Fabien. And any other man who happened to walk through the door. At the sight of a male guest, she’d launch into her seductive routine—tail aloft, gaze half-lidded, brushing past like a burlesque dancer in a fur coat. I could only watch, unamused, and top up her food.

Roxy, by contrast, had no need for performances. He would simply stroll into the room, his magnificent frame on full display, radiating silent authority. He didn’t need anyone’s attention.

Then, one day, Bianca disappeared, one day after our return home—and then she was gone. We searched, called, asked neighbours. No sign. No explanation. Not a trace. Was she stolen? Did she simply find somewhere more to her liking, as cats so often do? We’ll never know. But we prefer to believe she’s found a kind person who gives her everything she demands—and possibly a male companion she can flirt with to her heart’s content.

The ache remains, of course, but it softens with time, the way all grief eventually does—becoming part of the background noise of a life.

Roxy stayed until the very end. When his body began to betray him and the light in his eyes dulled, we made the hardest choice: to let him go peacefully, with love, retained of his calm pride. He left this world the way he lived in it—independent, stubborn but without complaint, and on his own terms.

They were characters. Friends, companions and family who shaped our days. And though they’re gone, they left their presence behind—still curled up somewhere in memory, still deeply loved.
