<h4>Ah, Agathe. What a marvellous character.</h4>

She could fool you in a heartbeat, convincing you she’s the very picture of innocence—quiet, composed, gentle as a breeze. An angel, really. Until, of course, she decides otherwise.

When Agathe acts, she does so without warning or fuss. No dramatic build-up, no rumbling growl—just a silent, surgical decision. Whether it’s a bark, a bite, or a sudden dash, it happens swiftly and without negotiation.

She is, after all, a hunter, but a rather elegant one. She knows her limits, or at least pretends to.

I’ll never forget the time she set her sights on Aristotle. I caught her watching him with unsettling intensity. When she realised I was observing her, she casually looked the other way—as if admiring the clouds. But all the while, she was waiting. And Aristotle, in his peculiar brilliance (or madness), knew how to play the game: he walked slowly, paused often, as if defusing a bomb. Agathe never gave up, but he outpaced her with sheer oddity.

Then came the Barcelona incident. A simple walk turned into a scene from a chase film. Agathe took off—and the other five followed, like well-trained chaos agents. Fabien and I happened to be nearby. He ran after them while the street erupted into pure mayhem.

As fate would have it, the poor dog groomer, who knew them all far too well, just happened to be passing by with her three tiny dogs. Agathe made a beeline. Fabien caught up just in time to see one small dog’s head entirely in Agathe’s mouth. With calm urgency, he ordered her to release—and miraculously, she did. No one was harmed. All six returned home—slightly puffed, but unbloodied.

I was mortified. The thought of turning up to the groomer as if nothing had happened felt absurd. So I went ahead of time, to see if she would still have us. She was visibly shaking, poor woman, but graciously agreed to reschedule all appointments… for the following week.

And yet, despite her _episodes_, my sweet Agathe remains mostly calm—calm with the occasional dash of chaos. We’ve all learned to work around her quirks, staying vigilant whenever she’s out and about. Not out of fear, but out of a shared understanding: that even angels have moments. Especially the hunting kind.
