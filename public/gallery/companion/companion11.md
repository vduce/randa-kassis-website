<h4>And now we come to Grace—the household’s very own police officer.</h4>
<br/>
Though in truth, she operates somewhere between law enforcement and organised crime. If reincarnation were real—and no, I don’t believe in such notions—I’d wager Grace was once an American politician of the particularly delusional variety: the sort who mistakes mediocrity for genius and speaks of freedom while quietly auctioning off the country behind closed doors.

She radiates that very particular brand of self-importance—the belief that she alone is holding civilisation together, from the front gate to the far end of the garden. All that’s missing is a flag-draped podium and a ghost-written autobiography titled _Grace: A Legacy of Barking_.

These days, she moves with careful precision—composed, deliberate, almost regal. But don’t be fooled: the old agitator is alive and well beneath the polished exterior. When a fight breaks out among her siblings, Grace doesn’t waste time with theatrics. She dives in with authority—not to break it up, but to win. She never backs down and absolutely never lets anyone else have the last word. Like any good politician, she’s mastered the art of selective restraint—she’ll withdraw when it suits her, but not a moment before.

Much like certain Americans, Grace seems to believe she is the police of the world—an illusion wrapped in noise and self-importance. She inserts herself into situations where no one asked for her presence, barking commands in the name of “order,” only to leave behind a trail of confusion, disrupted furniture, and very little resolution. Fights erupt, chaos reigns, and yet nothing truly changes. But unlike those on the global stage, Grace has learned something valuable over time: she now knows when to stay out of other people’s business.

Still, when real danger appears, she is unmistakably the one you’d want by your side. I remember when we were burgled in Rome. Fabien and I had gone to the other house (the guest house), leaving Nietzsche, Bonnie, and Grace behind after a minor domestic dispute. Fabien returned to fetch something—but didn’t come back out. I texted him. No answer. So I went to check.

The dogs were barking, but each in their own characteristically absurd way. Nietzsche, from his place on the ground-floor sofa, barked more out of intellectual principle than alarm. Bonnie, halfway up the stairs, was clearly observing protocol—taking no risks whatsoever.

But Grace—Grace was alert and ready to act. Agitated, standing on the first floor, she was the only one facing the direction of the intruders, visibly bracing herself to confront whatever was behind that door.

When the police arrived, we managed to unlock the bedroom—where the burglars had barricaded themselves before escaping via the balcony. Fabien later confirmed that all three dogs were still in their exact positions: Nietzsche calmly sounding solidarity from the sofa, Bonnie frozen mid-stair like a decorative statue, and Grace, restless and unwavering, guarding the threshold.

With age, Grace still greets us in a stampede of limbs and wild enthusiasm—but it is she who restores order. She barks like a one-dog border patrol, scolding the others for their uncontrolled joy. She doesn’t greet us—she manages the arrival.

Grace isn’t just a dog. She’s a self-appointed institution, quietly authoritarian, entirely self-assured, and absolutely convinced that without her, the household would slide into utter anarchy. And, inconveniently… she might be right.
