<h4>Whitty—the last male standing.</h4>

The only boy left in the house after the deaths of Nietzsche and Damascius, and the only male from the original litter still with us, following Clyde’s adoption and Winston’s relocation to my daughter’s home**.**

At times, Whitty appears genuinely lost—outnumbered and outmanoeuvred by five powerful females who show no hint of male solidarity. When one of them turns on him (which can happen without warning), there’s no one to defend him. No alliance. No brotherhood. Only the cold, unified front of female consensus. He looks to us with a pitiful, almost Shakespearean expression: eyes lowered, mouth ready to produce that slow, mournful whimper he’s perfected—equal parts tragedy and comedy.

Now, whether his gentleness and docility are a product of this matriarchal siege**,** or simply his spirit, I honestly don’t know. Despite his sizeable frame—one that occasionally startles passers-by—Whitty remains at heart a cuddly, oversized puppy, looking for kisses, belly rubs, and someone willing to play along.

He’s wonderfully easy-going—with strangers and familiars alike. When we’re out walking and he crosses paths with people unafraid of his size, it’s almost impossible for them to remain indifferent. On the contrary—they melt. They reach out to him with instinctive affection, and he knows exactly how to take it.

Whitty is no fool. He understands attention, affection, and how to earn both. With just the right tilt of the head and a few comic facial expressions, he charms effortlessly. 

It’s not that Whitty is theatrical—it’s that he thinks he is**.** He performs every gesture like a misunderstood genius longing for a standing ovation. If he were human, I’m quite certain he’d have gone into acting. Not, let’s be clear, the refined, layered brilliance of a British series—where subtlety and silence say more than dialogue ever could—but something unapologetically American: emotionally overcooked, visually exaggerated, each episode longer than necessary and rarely improved by a second season.

Yes, Whitty has the charm of a leading man, just not one written by the BBC. But we love him nonetheless. His softness, his shamelessness, his unshakable belief that one day someone in the house will actually take his side—all of it makes him, somehow, our dear little tragic star.
