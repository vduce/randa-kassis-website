<h4>Greco and Bobbie</h4>

Greco joined our family late in 2016 and passed away in 2023.

Bobbie arrived in early 2017 and left us in June 2021.

2016 felt like a gift—a year when so many beautiful beings appeared in our lives.

Greco was a wild cat when he first came to us. Untouchable. You couldn’t get near him. But as we all know, food is the only reliable way to corrupt—even cats. Slowly, he softened.

Then came Bobbie—an older cat, with an unusual, almost austere appearance, and a deeply ingrained mistrust of humans. He would hiss forcefully at the mere sight of a person. In truth, I couldn’t blame him. His suspicion seemed entirely reasonable, even wise. But something unexpected happened: Greco adopted him**.** And Bobbie, over time, began to let go of his suspicion, as though borrowing a little courage from his companion. He stopped hissing. He started trusting.

In Rome, Greco and Bobbie were inseparable. They claimed their room entirely—no other cats dared enter, and only persons were permitted in only to clean and feed them. They lived like an eccentric old couple—utterly devoted, delightfully territorial.

They stayed together until June 2021, when Bobbie’s health began to deteriorate. His body grew weaker by the day, but Greco never left his side. He remained loyal until Bobbie’s final breath. Bobbie passed away at the clinic—very old, the vets said, and simply at the end of his path.

We worried for Greco. He had lost his other half. And yet, life, as ever, insists on adaptation. Greco did his best to adjust. He reached out—first to Socrates (whom we still call Beria for reasons best not printed), and to Roxy, the silent one. He found no peace with Socrates, but he managed to form an unlikely alliance with Roxy, who accepted him in her own quiet way. He even held his own when Socrates—ever the bully—tried to assert dominance.

But life hadn’t finished with him yet. Before we moved to the UK, Greco was diagnosed with cancer. By then, it had already spread throughout his body. Despite every treatment—even chemotherapy—nothing could stop its course**.**

His body gave way, but he left us as he had lived in those final years: quietly, and with dignity. He died in our arms, in a British clinic, with familiar hands holding him until the very end.

Together, they were a universe—chaotic, noisy, opinionated, and occasionally deranged. Each had their own rhythm, neuroses, brilliance, charm, and yes, moments of staggering stupidity. They shaped our days one bark, hiss, pounce, or theatrical meltdown at a time. Some are still with us, others have gone, but their memories remain—firmly embedded in the fabric of our lives, and occasionally in the furniture.
