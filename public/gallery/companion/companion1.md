<h4>Nestor</h4>

Born January 1997 – Died November 2013

He came into this world the same year as my daughter, and I still remember how utterly depressed he looked after she was born—as if he sensed competition and immediately went on a hunger strike. The vet handed me syringes and medication, and off I went, force-feeding a dramatic furball with all the enthusiasm of a Victorian wet nurse.

Three weeks later, the sulking subsided and he grudgingly accepted her as a sort of companion-in-infancy. Over time—and after several well-placed nibbles—they evolved into siblings. Not the affectionate kind, mind you, but more the passive-aggressive “I’ll eat your face if you touch my toy” sort.

He had a particular disdain for waiters and waitresses. His favourite spot was under the table, plotting his next assault. Even when I lifted him onto my seat, he’d launch surprise attacks on unsuspecting ankles. What began as a nibble sometimes turned into full-blown foot terrorism, ending in awkward apologies—sometimes from me, sometimes from the poor person who thought they’d somehow harmed him. They hadn’t. He was just a little git.

He was small in size but made up for it with a big mouth and a monumental sense of entitlement. Children often wanted to pet him, which sent me into instant panic mode. I’d warn their parents, explaining he wasn’t fond of strangers—particularly miniature ones. Most of them stared blankly as if I were reciting Sanskrit, so I ended up holding him like a neurotic handbag most of the time.

In his final years, my daughter became more than a sister to him—she was his mother. She looked after him tenderly whenever I was off attending Syrian meetings or otherwise preoccupied with trying to save the world.

No one was saved—except, perhaps, Nestor, from ever having to suffer a toddler again.
