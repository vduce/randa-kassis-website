<h4>Nietzsche</h4>

Adopted in November 2015 – Died in September 2022

A few months after we arrived in Greece, I began encountering several stray dogs. Each time I returned home, I searched for them in the streets and feed them.

One day, in Kosta, I saw him—sitting calmly at the port. I was worried and called a vet to make sure he was alright.

From that day on, whenever I came back, I would always look for him, feed him, and ensure he was safe. My love for him grew deeper with time, and we eventually decided to adopt him—keeping a space between him and Roxy.

He stayed in a part of my heart. For seven years, he followed us—alongside our other companions—across many countries, often to the sound of his favourite songs by Miles Davis and Nina Simone.

The first time he started singing, we didn’t understand what was happening. Concerned, we called George, the vet—but there was nothing to note. He was in perfect health.

Then it happened again. And again. Until we finally made the connection between his voice and the song _You Put a Spell on You_. From then on, he sang often—sometimes with Miles Davis, sometimes even with classical music.

Nietzsche had developed a real sense of music.

When he stared at someone, it was to speak through his eyes. And somehow, everyone understood what he was trying to say.

I named him Nietzsche, and the name suited him perfectly. He was a true philosopher—one who seemed to grasp the essence of life in all its layers.

But nothing lasts forever… He left me suddenly. And yet, my love for him will never die.

He will always be my Nietzsche.
