<h4>The Litter of Nine</h4>

Born May 2016

As is customary in our absence, the universe decided to deliver chaos straight to our gate. This time, it came in the form of nine puppies, barely a month old, mysteriously deposited between our home and the  residence of the former Greek king—presumably by someone who thought, “Well, they already have a zoo, what’s nine more?”

No one claimed them, of course. No one _except_ us. Naturally.

We received the call while away: “There’s a small situation at your gate.” Upon returning, we were greeted not by a situation but by an ecstatic, four-legged stampede—nine balls of fur bouncing in every direction, biting ankles with joy, and ambushing anything that moved. It was less a litter, more a coordinated invasion.

We decided to keep them—temporarily, we said, as one does when staring down a wall of puppy eyes. But even we had to admit that eleven dogs and four cats might just be one dog short of an intervention.

Thankfully, a small miracle occurred: Clyde, one of the ringleaders, was adopted by a priest. And in an unexpected twist that still makes me chuckle, my daughter adopted two of them—a male and a female—thus beginning a proud new chapter in our family story.

I am now, quite officially, a great-mother. Yes, to dogs. Two utterly spoiled great-grandpuppies, whose sense of entitlement is matched only by their cuteness. I didn’t expect to enter canine matriarchy so soon, but here we are—and frankly, I wouldn’t trade it for anything. Except, perhaps, a quiet house.

In the end, we kept six of the puppies—along with Nietzsche and Damascius.
