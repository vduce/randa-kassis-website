<h4>Let’s begin with Countess Bonnie</h4>

To this day, she remains fastidiously concerned with her _figure_—clearly above the vulgar excitement of chasing down treats or scavenging pizza crusts like the common folk. Oh no. Bonnie approaches food as one might approach a suspicious diplomatic offering.

First, she gives it a cautious sniff. Then, in true aristocratic fashion, she observes the others—does anyone collapse after eating it? Any sudden drama? No? Only then, perhaps, will she deign to _taste_ a morsel. And should she actually _swallow_ it instead of spitting it out—well, it’s a triumph worth recording in the family archive.

If she disapproves of what’s on offer, she performs a flawless silent protest: she turns her back with the grace of a duchess declining an invitation, walks away at a pace that says _“I’m above this,”_ and settles herself on the nearest sofa where she remains, eyes half-closed, pretending the rest of us don’t exist.

Bonnie lives her life on her own terms: serene, aloof, and entirely unbothered. She doesn’t bark, bicker, or belittle. She simply _is_—above the fray, beyond the nonsense, and, frankly, far more dignified than the rest of us combined.
