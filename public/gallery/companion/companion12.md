<h4>Vodka is the strategist—the war planner of the household.</h4>
<br/>
She doesn’t waste time with unnecessary movement, nor does she bark just for the sake of hearing her own voice, unlike some of her more excitable siblings. Everything she does is calculated, almost surgical. If Vodka lifts a paw, it’s because it serves a purpose. If she barks, it’s because the situation has escalated to DEFCON 2.

She’s not interested in performance. She conserves her energy like a Cold War operative—stoic, unreadable, and two steps ahead. When she acts, it’s with precision, and when the moment demands force, she delivers it with such ferocity that even the walls seem to lean away in caution. She is, without question, the real alpha—not by noise or display, but by sheer presence. And when someone crosses a line—and I mean really crosses it—she responds. And by then, no one can de-escalate the situation. Not even Zeus himself, chief deity of Olympus, could have rallied the gods quickly enough to stop her.

Vodka is sharp—razor-sharp. She crosses your blood-brain barrier with unnerving ease. One moment you’re relaxed in her presence, lulled into a strange state of calm, and the next, your internal footing slips. She leaves you off balance, uncertain, and—like her namesake—wondering why you can’t walk in a straight line anymore.

Yes, she’s at least 40% more intense than the others—and you feel it. A Vodka episode leaves you dazed, blinking at the wall, vaguely aware that something has occurred but unsure of the details.

And yet, once the air clears and normality resumes, you’ll find her lounging with serene detachment—perhaps one paw draped across the wall, as if she’d simply corrected the course of history and now needed a brief nap.

She is not a follower, nor a show-off. She is what happens when silence learns to bark only when it must—and by then, it’s already far too late.
