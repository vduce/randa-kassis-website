<h4>In Their Gaze</h4>

When we find ourselves immersed in nature—surrounded by animals and far from the bustling human world—our breath becomes lighter, and life more joyful. Watching a wild animal in its element, sensing the climax of a moment suspended between life and death, reminds us that existence is not a straight line, but a pulse: tense, fleeting, and fiercely present.  
Even when we encounter stray dogs and cats, life seems to take on another meaning. Yet, sadly, we are forced to confront the reality that the human being is often a calamity from which life must continually emerge and defend itself.
