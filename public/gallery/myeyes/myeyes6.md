<h4>Traces of Atrocity</h4>

Some places do not speak—they mourn. Not out of reverence, but because there is nothing left to say. Genocide reveals not just human cruelty, but human credulity: the urge to annihilate in the name of gods, beliefs, or abstractions.  
What remains is not memory, but residue. Not grief, but a void—mute, inert, and untouched by meaning. These are not sites of reflection but evidence: of ritualised violence, of destruction as a form of self-justification, of the ego seeking permanence through erasure.  
I remember history only to confirm this: that man is an obedient destroyer, driven not by understanding, but by faith in illusions. Recompense becomes his engine—an imagined reward for loyalty, paid for with the lives of others, in a desperate attempt to fill the hollow of his existence.  
At memorial museums, I do not find solace—only the echo of absence formalised. These curated remnants do not console; they confront. They whisper not remembrance, but warning: that nothing is ever truly learned, only ritualised and repeated.
