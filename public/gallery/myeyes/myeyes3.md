<h4>Ruins That Speak</h4>

A stone found at an archaeological site is not merely a remnant of construction; it is a fragment of enduring memoryâ€”both human and geological. Formed through natural processes and later shaped by human hands, it bears the silent imprint of civilisations, rituals, and vanished worlds. Archaeology reminds us that life is not defined by human presence alone, but emerges from the prolonged interplay between organic and inorganic matter across deep time.  
Whenever I find myself before such ruins, my memory and emotions are transported to that distant past, awakening all my senses.
