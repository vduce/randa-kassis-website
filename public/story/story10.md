The Absurdity of Emotions and the Hierarchy of Beings

I recognise the absurdity of emotions—love, fear, joy, grief—yet I also saw their fleeting intensity as the very fabric of life’s meaning, even if that meaning was an illusion.
Humans, I thought, were burdened by their awareness of life’s absurdity, suffering more profoundly than other creatures who simply existed in harmony with nature. This is why I considered animals superior to humans—free from existential dread, they lived in peaceful accord with the natural world.
My thoughts often wandered towards reordering the hierarchy of existence. I would elevate dogs to the pinnacle and demote humans to the level of worms. If I could, I would burn the gods and uproot the virus of religion from the human mind. If I had the power, I would sterilise humanity as I did with the stray animals—not out of cruelty, but out of mercy. Like them, humans are trapped in a cycle of suffering they are too blind to break. In Greece, I spared the strays the misery of endless reproduction; if only humans could be spared their own self-inflicted torment.
