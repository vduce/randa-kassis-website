As a child, I was inquisitive—curious about the world, about my body, about the invisible rules that dictated how I should exist within it. I remember being five or six years old, exploring myself with innocent curiosity, only to discover something I had been conditioned to believe was impure. My instinct was to cleanse, to rid myself of what I thought was dirt. But that act—simple and instinctive—was also my first conscious rejection of an imposed taboo.

Later, as an adolescent, I repeated the act—not out of naivety, but with full intention. I had no desire for my hymen to be lost through sexual intercourse, for it to be a symbol of virtue or a transaction. I despised its very concept.

Even before I understood rebellion in an intellectual sense, I had already lived it. Algeria shaped me in ways I could never have anticipated. It was there that I grasped the nature of power—how it operates, how it can be resisted. I had moved from a relatively sheltered world into an environment where survival meant more than just existing; it required assertion, defiance, a willingness to stand one’s ground. I was not born a fighter, but Algeria made me one.
