<center><h4>Back to Syria: A Turbulent Teenage Rebel<h4><center>

When I returned to Syria at twelve, I rebelled against everyone—authority, the police, and especially the political system. I refused to be enrolled in the Shabiba (Ba’ath Youth), rejecting the indoctrination and slogans forced upon students. I never accepted being just a number in this country—a cog in the system that dictated how we should think, act, and exist.

Since the age of fourteen, I had engaged my friends in Damascus in debates over the existence of God. Back then, no one dared question religion or the notion of a creator. They labelled me a heretic, believing that me disregard for social and political order was a direct result of my rejection of both God and authority.

At fifteen, my rebellion deepened. I made acquaintances with French employees at the French Cultural Centre, where I found an intellectual and cultural connection that was absent among my own friends. At the same time, I travelled across Syria with friends my age, engaging in endless debates about God, religions, and the taboos that society tried to impose on us.

Since adolescence, life was something to be consumed—every last drop, whether bitter or sweet.

After my baccalaureate, I went to Germany to study, but I quickly realised that its structured, rigid, and highly organised society did not suit me. It felt too constrained, too predictable, too confining.

There, I met refugees who had fled war—Lebanese, Palestinians—and for the first time, I truly connected with the full scope of Palestinian suffering, beyond the fragments I had heard from my mother, who worked at UNRWA in Damascus, or the stories of resistance I had encountered at school.

I went to Paris, the city I had first fallen in love with at ten years old—a place that had left an imprint on my mind. Paris had always felt like home: its intellectual vibrancy, its artistic defiance, its embrace of free thought resonated with the spirit of rebellion I carried within me.

Yet, over time, I found myself caught between two forces—one that compelled me to act, to create, to fight for change, and another that whispered the absurdity of it all. I was passionate about causes, about ideas, about possibilities, but I also saw the futility in human existence. I oscillated between engagement and nihilism, between building something new and accepting that nothing truly lasts. Death was not something I feared; rather, I saw it as an inevitable release— perhaps even a form of salvation. And maybe that’s why I sought movement, why stability never suited me—I needed to chase moments of fascination before they lost their meaning.

I met a young Israeli woman, the same age as me, and we became very close. Her life was a tragedy in itself—a mother who had survived the Shoah, a father who refused to acknowledge her, and the wreckage of two failed love stories. Over time, life became increasingly unbearable for her, and depression consumed her until, one day, she chose to surrender herself to death.

The police advised me not to see her body, urging me to preserve the memory of her as the beautiful woman I had known. But through her, I began to truly understand both miseries—Palestinian and Israeli.

Never once did I feel a sense of satisfaction. I drifted from psychology to painting, passed through writing, and eventually found myself in politics—never settling, always searching, as if no path could contain me.
