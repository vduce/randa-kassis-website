<center><h4>Moving Forward, Without Illusions<center><h4>

Today, I continue to live within that contradiction. I advocate for change while questioning its value. I embrace the temporary, fully aware that permanence is an illusion. I do not believe in an ideal world, nor do I seek one. Instead, I move forward, navigating life’s currents much as I always have—without illusions, without submission, and without regret.
