<center><h4>1997–2007: A Life of Art, Motherhood, and Fighting Spirit<center></h4>

Between 1997 and 2007, I balanced motherhood, art, and self-discipline. I had separated from my daughter’s father when she was almost two years old. Until she was fourteen, when the Syrian revolt began, my life was intertwined with hers.

I drove her to her activities, to see friends—we travelled together, went out often, even with my own friends. I was never absent from her life. But at the same time, I pursued my own path, refusing to let motherhood define me entirely.

Alongside this, I trained in kickboxing and Muay Thai—not just for self-defence, but for self-control. The discipline I gained in combat extended beyond the ring, shaping how I approached life itself.

Seeking another artistic outlet, I enrolled at Cours Florent, immersing myself in performance and storytelling. Theatre gave me a voice—a structured yet liberating way to channel my thoughts and emotions. It was through this experience that I later began writing for Al Hiwar Al Mutamadin.
