Political Fight: A Struggle for Secularism and Inclusion

Yet, entering politics forced me to reorganise my ideas—for I knew that most people needed some structures to order their lives. Thus emerged my quest to find a balance—one that respected individual freedom while ensuring enough structure to maintain order, without stripping away personal identity or crushing the human desire for self-fulfilment.

The Arab Spring and My Exclusion from the Opposition
In 2010, I played a key role in commentating on and writing about the Tunisian revolution. As the Arab Spring gathered momentum, I felt compelled to return to Syrian political life. I co-founded, alongside other opponents, the secular democratic forces against Bashar al-Assad, which led to my position in the Syrian National Council (SNC).

fundamentalists within the opposition made me a target. By May 2012, I was expelled from the SNC—cast aside by the very movement I had helped build. Many within the Syrian opposition, including former allies, actively worked against me, seeking to silence my voice and remove me from political life. My unwavering secular stance had made me an outsider, but I refused to retreat.

A New Political Vision: Building a Pluralistic Future

During this turbulent period, my life took both a personal and political turn. I met my love, Fabien Baussart, who would later become my husband and a partner in political initiatives. Together, we launched multiple political projects to counter the forces that had excluded me.

Determined to continue my fight for a secular, pluralistic Syria, I established the Movement for a Pluralistic Society with the help of Fabien, following my exclusion from both the SNC and the secular democratic forces. This was my way of ensuring that the principles of secularism, democracy, and coexistence did not disappear amid the chaos of war and extremism.

The Astana Platform: A Path to Diplomacy
One of the key political initiatives I spearheaded was the Astana Platform, which I launched with Fabien in 2015, after requesting that the President of Kazakhstan establish a space to unite moderate Syrian opposition figures.

I participated in the 2016 Geneva Peace Talks as part of the Moscow/Astana groups, serving as Co-President alongside Qadri Jamil in the Syrian secular and democratic opposition delegation.

Once again, both allies and enemies conspired to exclude me from the Geneva negotiations in 2017. However, Fabien and I responded by launching a new initiative to establish a constitutional committee. This initiative was made possible with the support of former Italian Foreign Minister Giulio Terzi and former Turkish Foreign Minister Yaşar Yakış, along with the collaboration of Syrian and French constitutional experts.

On 13 January 2018, I, along with other members of the Astana Platform, participated in the Syrian National Congress as President of the Astana Platform. There, I emphasised the urgency of creating a constitutional committee to facilitate Syria’s peace process. The proposal was later adopted by the UN and the Astana Troika (Russia, Iran, and Turkey), marking a significant step towards a political resolution.

Fighting for Secularism Against Political Exclusion
My journey in Syrian politics has been marked by exclusion, betrayal, and constant battles—not just against the Assad regime, but also against factions within the opposition that sought to erase secular voices from the movement.

Yet, despite their attempts to silence me, I remained unwavering. I created new platforms, new alliances, and alternative pathways to keep the secular, democratic vision for Syria alive. My political fight was never about seeking a position or personal recognition—it was, and remains, a struggle to defend a Syria where secularism and pluralism are not erased by either authoritarianism or fundamentalism.

Legacy of Resistance and Political Survival
The political landscape remains treacherous, but survival is its own form of resistance. While many of my former allies turned against me, I continue to shape discussions, influence policy, and push forward alternatives to religious and authoritarian rule.

Exclusion did not weaken me—it strengthened my resolve. In a war where voices are either bought, silenced, or erased, mine stands defiant.
