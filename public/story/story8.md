AD-HOC Organisation

In 2016, I co-organised two major conferences. The first, held in Brussels, was titled The Roots of Terrorism: Secularism as the Solution, and brought together influential voices such as the Syrian poet Adonis, the Egyptian thinker Sayyid Al-Qimni, and Ensaf Haidar, wife of the imprisoned Saudi blogger Raif Badawi. The second, later that year, tackled the subject of Islamic Fascism, featuring speakers like Hamed Abdel-Samad and the Moroccan philosopher Said Nachid. These events were not just about discussion—they were an assertion of the presence of Arab secularists in a region where they are often silenced.

Loss, Grief, and the Search for Meaning
Since my withdrawal from political life in 2019 and the loss of my beloved dog, Nietzsche, I have plunged into a deep state of grief. Nietzsche was more than just a pet; he was an exceptional companion. He possessed an extraordinary sensitivity to music and a remarkable intelligence. His presence was a silent symphony—an extension of the philosopher whose name he bore.

To ease my sorrow, I delved into Roger Penrose’s hypothesis of quantum consciousness. Yet, as an atheist, I struggled to reconcile my grief with any notion of continuity after death. It felt like a desperate attempt to bridge the gap between loss and logic. I remember vividly that he passed away just one day before Queen Elizabeth—a coincidence that felt both meaningless and strangely poetic.
My path has always spiralled inward, rejecting simplicity and craving unfiltered truth. This contradiction within me—my relentless pursuit of change despite my belief in life’s futility—defines who I am. Perhaps the end is the moment peace arrives. Perhaps that is why I never settle, always seeking to escape life’s monotonous routine.

Occasionally, life would surprise me, overwhelming me with its fleeting beauty. In those moments, I felt the whisper of freedom—a breeze that stirred me, as if chasing an elusive fragrance. I longed to immerse myself in its breath, to feel it brush my face. Yet even in those flashes of vitality, life revealed itself to me as Thanatos—a kaleidoscope of memories and meanings intertwined with the faces of the departed. The image of my beloved Nietzsche would often emerge, igniting an ache that nestled deep within my heart.
