I have no right to weep for you, for I was never by your side. I have no right to speak of pain, for I was always far from you.

I cannot even ask for your forgiveness, for you have departed this life, and there is no life for you beyond it. How, then, can I console myself, when I have spent years burdened by the bitterness of self-reproach since my father’s passing? I left just days before his death. I didn’t remain by his side until the end. Was I fleeing from grief, from finality? Or was I simply placing myself above all else? I do not know…

But I do know that I have done it again—with you. I returned to Syria a month before your death, yet I left you once more. Was it something in my blood, an instinct to escape? Or do I carry a detachment that even I do not fully understand? Perhaps… I will find no answer until my own final moments—only then will I know what you both felt when we left you behind.

And I do not know why I write these words. Am I confessing my failures, declaring to the world that I was a daughter who never truly thought of you? Or am I simply trying to release the weight that chokes me? Perhaps I am just someone incapable of keeping emotions locked within, needing to declare to all: I am who I am.

Nothing has stripped me of my strength as your absence has. Nothing has left me so exposed to my sorrow as your passing has. I know you devoted yourself to others, but I am certain that our distance caused you sadness—even if you never admitted it, even if you refused to acknowledge it. And I know, too, that we all disappointed you. You had every right to feel that way. For had my own daughter done to me what I did to you, I would have felt the same.

At night, when I struggle to sleep, despite the breathing exercises and techniques that no longer bring relief, my mind drifts far away. I stare into the void, drowning in memories of all those I have loved—you among them. And I admit that I was harsh with you—or perhaps harshness has simply become a part of me. I search for you, for all those I have loved and lost, within the corridors of my mind, which still clings to your memory and theirs. No doubt you are more vivid now because your departure is the most recent, while my memory has pushed away those who left long ago. I wonder in silence: Can you hear me, wherever you are? But reason whispers back: There is no one there to listen.

All I have left of you are memories and the image of your face in my mind, just like those who passed before you. I will carry your memory like an ember in my heart—painful, yet the only thing that keeps me close to you. No other world will reunite us, but you will remain alive within me—an eternal presence, with me for the rest of my days.

My only solace is knowing that you are free from pain.

And so, I write—not to seek redemption, nor to be absolved of what I cannot change, but simply because silence is unbearable.
