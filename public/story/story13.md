<center><h4>The Absurdity of Emotions and the Hierarchy of Beings<h4><center>

I recognise the absurdity of emotions—love, fear, joy, grief—but I also saw their fleeting intensity as the very fabric of life’s meaning, even if that meaning was illusion.

Humans, I believed, are burdened by their awareness of life’s absurdity, suffering more profoundly than other creatures who simply exist in harmony with nature. This is why I regarded animals as superior—free from existential dread, they live in accordance with the rhythms of the nature world. 

My thoughts often drifted towards reordering the hierarchy of existence. I would elevate dogs to the pinnacle, seeing in them a purity and equilibrium that humanity had long abandoned. If I could, I would burn the gods and eradicate the virus of religion from the human minds.  If I had the power, I would sterilise humanity as I did the stray—not out of cruelty, but out of mercy. 

Like them, humans are trapped in a cycle of suffering they are too blind to break. In Greece, I spared strays the misery of endless reproduction; if only humankind could be spared its own self-inflicted torment.
