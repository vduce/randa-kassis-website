<center><h4>2007: The Turning Point — My Atheist and Political Activism</h4></center>
<br/>

In 2007, I began writing to challenge religious and political dogmas in the Arab world. My knowledge of psychology and anthropology helped me dissect religions and cultures, which became the foundation of my first articles, writings, and TV program.

I wrote publicly, encouraged by my elder brother Nabil, who believed in me and in my ability to write. Perhaps I had inherited this gift from my father—the ability to dismantle the dogmas that governed so many aspects of life in the Arab world.

At the time, platforms like Al Hiwar Al Mutamadin (Civil Discourse) were among the few spaces where secularists, atheists, and free thinkers could engage in meaningful discussions without censorship. Through these debates, I connected with like-minded individuals such as Kacem El Ghazzali, Waleed Al-Husseini, and many others who, like me, waged an intellectual rebellion against the constraints imposed by religion and tradition.

My activism wasn’t confined to words—it was action. I helped ex-Muslims escape persecution—providing financial and logistical support, and at times, offering them refuge when they had nowhere else to turn.
