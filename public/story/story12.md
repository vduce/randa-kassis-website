Moving Forward, Without Illusions

Today, I continue to live in that contradiction. I advocate for change while questioning its worth. I embrace the temporary, knowing that permanence is an illusion. I do not believe in an ideal world, nor do I seek one. Instead, I move forward, navigating the currents of life much as I always haveâ€”without illusions, without submission, and without regret.
