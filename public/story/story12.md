<center><h4>The Contradiction That Defines Me</h4></center>

Since adolescence, I had embraced nihilism—living each day as it came, indifferent to the future. But the birth of my daughter stirred something imperceptible within me: an unseen force that subtly tempered my once unrestrained defiance.

In those rare moments of stillness, I would catch my own reflection in her eyes and think, _“What if I were to disappear all of a sudden?”_ It was an uninvited thought, yet one that recurred often enough to become a part of me. After all, my daughter had no one but me.

My profound love and fierce attachment to her inevitably compelled me to reconsider my anarchic tendencies—not to abandon them, but at least to rein in the chaos within. And yet, I still savoured the taste of disorder—the raw, untamed freedom that refused to be buried.
