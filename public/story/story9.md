<center><h4>Looking Back: The Unyielding Fight for Free Thought and Meaning</h4></center>
<br/>

Looking back, my journey has always been about questioning the unquestionable—about challenging the boundaries imposed by both religion and politics. And while the landscape has shifted in many ways, the fight for free thought in the Arab world remains as urgent as ever.

Beyond my political work, I devoted myself to animal welfare. In Porto Heli, Fabien and I managed a shelter for stray animals, providing healthcare, sterilisation, and rehoming. The fight for human liberation and the fight for animal welfare were, in my eyes, intertwined—both driven by a desire to challenge the structures that perpetuate suffering.

Together with Fabien, we rescued many pets from the streets, animals that had been abandoned or left to fend for themselves. They became our cherished companions, each one bearing a story of survival.
