<center><h4>The First Battle: Defying Power</h4></center>
<br/>

My first physical confrontation was a defining moment. It happened in the schoolyard—a place that, for many children, is merely a setting for games and lessons, but for me, it became an early battlefield. A group of boys, emboldened by their own sense of entitlement, sought to intimidate me. I refused to shrink. When one of them made his move, I retaliated. I knocked him to the ground, but that act of defiance came at a price. The boys turned on me, pelting me with stones.

The pain was real, but it wasn’t what left a mark on me. What I remember most vividly isn’t the pain—it’s the realisation that fear is a weapon. And I could choose not to carry it. I stood there, battered but unbroken, and something shifted within me. I knew that mere defence was not enough. I had to go on the offensive. 

I charged towards one of the boys, grabbed a stone larger than the ones they had thrown, and raised it high. For a brief second, I hesitated. Did I truly intend to strike? Or was it enough that they believed I would? I will never know the answer. What I do know is that in that moment, the balance of power changed. I saw fear flicker in their eyes, and with it, I understood something fundamental: power is an illusion, sustained only by submission. I had refused to submit.

That moment did not just shape how others saw me; it shaped how I saw myself. It changed my place in that school. The girls, who had once been passive observers, now looked to me for protection. The boys, who had sought to put me in my place, now knew I would not be tamed. But beyond that, something deeper had taken root in me. I understood, in a visceral way, that authority—whether in the form of a schoolyard bully or a greater system—was only as strong as our willingness to accept it. That lesson stayed with me. 

Over time, I distanced myself from all girls who had once followed the script written for them. I questioned religion, society, morality—every structure that sought to define my existence. My father, an agnostic, had instilled in me the value of independent thought, and I took that lesson to its extreme. I rejected all imposed beliefs, seeing them as viruses infecting human minds. My disdain for authority extended beyond the personal to the political, and my involvement in Syria’s revolution was not just a political stance—it was an extension of who I had become.

Algeria was my second birth. It was there that I first saw myself clearly, as though I had been shedding layers all along, waiting for the moment when my true nature would finally emerge. Perhaps my first physical fight with the boys at school had been the catalyst for this change. In that moment, I understood—as did everyone else—that the quiet Syrian Randa no longer existed. Fear had left her, and no authority, no God, could intimidate her again

Since childhood, I had wrestled with life’s most perplexing questions: What is life? Why do we cling to it so fiercely? Is it driven by our egocentrism, or merely the cowardice to sever what procreation has set in motion?
