<br/>

At the beginning of 1994, I started painting. My brother, Jean—one of the greatest contemporary painters in my eyes—was my first inspiration. I was drawn to his creative style, captivated by the raw intensity of his work.

For me, painting was never just a craft; it was an act of defiance—a rebellion against imposed narratives and the rigid expectations of what a woman should be. My work was raw, unfiltered, unapologetic. From the very beginning, my art was a form of resistance, a means to challenge the world as I saw it—to reject the suffocating conventions that sought to dictate how a woman, a body, or an artist should be perceived.

The female form has always been central to my work, but not in the way it’s been commodified for centuries. I refused to depict it as a passive object of beauty or desire. To me, the body is a battlefield—a paradox, both a prison and a tool of liberation. My brushstrokes were never meant to comfort; they were meant to provoke, to unearth something unsettling—something that forces the viewer to confront their own gaze, their own biases.

I never cared for perfect symmetry or predictable aesthetics. I paint to merge chaos with structure, to blend dream and reality until the line between them collapses. My canvases don’t tell linear stories—they vibrate, they pulse with contradictions. Critics have said my work feels like music—that it carries its own rhythm. I like that idea, because art, for me, has always been about breaking silence, shattering complacency.

I’ve exhibited my work in different places, seen people stare, question, sometimes even recoil. And I embrace that. Art should be unsettling. It should gnaw at something inside you—push you to see beyond the surface.
