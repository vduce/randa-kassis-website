Painting - A Style of Life

At the beginning of 1994, I started painting. My brother, Jean—one of the greatest contemporary painters in my eyes—was my first inspiration. I was drawn to his creative style, captivated by the raw intensity of his work.

For me, painting was never just a craft; it was an act of defiance—a rebellion against imposed narratives and the rigid expectations of what a woman should be. My work was raw, unfiltered, unapologetic. From the very beginning, my art was a form of resistance, a means to challenge the world as I saw it—to reject the suffocating conventions that sought to dictate how a woman, a body, or an artist should be perceived.

The female form has always been central to my work, but not in the way it’s been commodified for centuries. I refused to depict it as a passive object of beauty or desire. To me, the body is a battlefield—a paradox, both a prison and a tool of liberation. My brushstrokes were never meant to comfort; they were meant to provoke, to unearth something unsettling—something that forces the viewer to confront their own gaze, their own biases.

I never cared for perfect symmetry or predictable aesthetics. I paint to merge chaos with structure, to blend dream and reality until the line between them collapses. My canvases don’t tell linear stories—they vibrate, they pulse with contradictions. Critics have said my work feels like music—that it carries its own rhythm. I like that idea, because art, for me, has always been about breaking 
silence, shattering complacency.

I’ve exhibited my work in different places, seen people stare, question, sometimes even recoil. And I embrace that. Art should be unsettling. It should gnaw at something inside you—push you to see beyond the surface.

Between 1997 and 2007, I balanced motherhood, art, and self-discipline. I had separated from my daughter’s father when she was almost two years old. Until she was fourteen, when the Syrian revolt began, my life was intertwined with hers.

I drove her to her activities, to see friends—we travelled together, went out often, even with my own friends. I was never absent from her life. But at the same time, I pursued my own path, refusing to let motherhood define me entirely.

Alongside this, I trained in kickboxing and Muay Thai—not just for self-defence, but for self-control. The discipline I gained in combat extended beyond the ring, shaping how I approached life itself.

Seeking another artistic outlet, I enrolled at Cours Florent, immersing myself in performance and storytelling. Theatre gave me a voice—a structured yet liberating way to channel my thoughts and emotions. It was through this experience that I later began writing for Al Hiwar Al Mutamadin.

In 2007, I began writing to challenge religious and political dogmas in the Arab world. My knowledge of psychology and anthropology helped me dissect religions and cultures, which became the foundation of my first articles, writings, and television programme.

I wrote publicly, encouraged by my elder brother, Nabil, who believed in me and in my ability to write. Perhaps I had inherited this gift from my father—the ability to dismantle the dogmas that governed so many aspects of life in the Arab world.

At the time, platforms like Al Hiwar Al Mutamadin (Civil Discourse) were among the few spaces where secularists, atheists, and free thinkers could engage in meaningful discussions without censorship. Through these debates, I connected with like-minded individuals such as Kacem El Ghazzali, Waleed Al-Husseini, and many others who, like me, waged an intellectual rebellion against the constraints imposed by religion and tradition.

My activism wasn’t confined to words—it was action. I helped ex-Muslims escape persecution—providing financial and logistical support, and at times offering them refuge when they had nowhere else to turn.
