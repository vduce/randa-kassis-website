<h4>Kazakhstan Peace Talks</h4>

Presidential Palace, Senate and Rixos Hotel, Astana  
17-18 September 2015

<b>Summary:</b>

The Kazakhstan Peace Talks, organised by the Centre of Political and Foreign Affairs (CPFA) in cooperation with the Kazakh authorities, took place in September 2015 in Astana. This event was distinct from the later formal Astana II meeting.

Following the first Astana meeting in May 2015, Randa Kassis played a central role in encouraging the continuation of dialogue by calling upon President Nursultan Nazarbayev to deepen Kazakhstanâ€™s engagement in supporting a political solution to the Syrian conflict. In response to this appeal, the Kazakhstan Peace Talks were convened to maintain momentum and to provide a platform for pragmatic and moderate Syrian opposition figures to further refine a common roadmap.

During the conference, Kassis reiterated the urgent need for inclusive negotiations and constructive preparation among opposition forces, to strengthen their role in future international discussions. The Kazakhstan Peace Talks contributed to laying the foundations for subsequent initiatives and for the broader engagement of the Astana Platform in the Syrian peace process.
