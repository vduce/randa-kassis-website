<h4>CPFA Convenes High-Level Meeting Opposing Normalisation with the Assad Regime</h4>

CPFA, London<br>
26 June 2023 

<b>Summary:</b>

As the Middle East undergoes a shifting regional realignment, certain states are considering the normalisation of relations with Syriaâ€”a country still engulfed in civil war and facing an escalating Captagon crisis. In this context, the Centre for Political and Foreign Affairs (CPFA) convened a high-level meeting to voice opposition to any normalisation with the Assad regime and to assess the broader geopolitical implications such moves could have for regional stability and European security.

The event was honoured by the presence of General Sir Mark Carleton-Smith, former Chief of the General Staff and former Director of UK Special Forces, as guest of honour. Randa Kassis, President of the Astana Platform, also took part, delivering a clear critique of attempts to rehabilitate the Assad regime without meaningful political reform or accountability.

The meeting provided a platform for strategic dialogue on the risks of legitimising a regime widely condemned for human rights violations, while also addressing the potential repercussions for international security and the principles underpinning a just political resolution in Syria.
