<h4>Summary:</h4>	

Randa Kassis founded the Movement for a Pluralistic Society during a gathering at the prestigious Cercle de l’Union Interalliée in Paris. The movement emerged in response to the increasing Islamist dominance within the Syrian opposition, particularly within the Syrian National Council (CNS), which Kassis criticised for having been manipulated by the Muslim Brotherhood from its inception.

As an openly atheist political figure, Kassis embodied a symbolic and decisive rupture with religious influence over opposition forces. Her initiative sought to alert Syrians to the dangers posed by Islamism, jihadist infiltration, and the abuses perpetrated by factions of the Free Syrian Army (FSA). The Movement for a Pluralistic Society advocated a secular and democratic future for Syria, supporting a unified opposition free from Islamist currents.

Kassis further called for the restructuring of the Syrian military forces, proposing the establishment of a professional army composed primarily of defectors (career soldiers), coordinated under a joint political and military command representative of all revolutionary and opposition movements. Moreover, the movement championed the constitutional recognition of Kurdish rights, condemning the CNS’s exclusion of Kurdish representatives and its alignment with Islamist agendas.

Through these positions, Randa Kassis endeavoured to promote a truly inclusive, secular, and democratic alternative for Syria’s future.
