<h4>Political Café</h4>

<h4>Summary:</h4>	

At the Political Café organised by the Youth of the UMP in Neuilly, Randa Kassis critically assessed the failure of the Geneva II Conference. She argued that limiting the opposition’s representation to the Syrian National Coalition (SNC) weakened the talks’ credibility and allowed the Assad regime to exploit the divisions.

Kassis highlighted Russia’s dissatisfaction with the SNC’s rigid and unrealistic stance, noting that the exclusion of other secular and moderate opposition groups contributed significantly to the collapse of the negotiations. She emphasised that any future settlement would require a broader, more pragmatic opposition and the constructive involvement of key international actors, particularly Russia.
