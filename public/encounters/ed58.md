<h4>Reshaping Society</h4>

TEDx, Manouba, Tunisia  
15 January 2012  
Speaker: Randa Kassis
 
<b>Summary:</b>	

Tunisia is facing numerous challenges one year after the revolution. TEDxENSI will present new ideas aimed at addressing these issues and contributing to the construction of a renewed society—one grounded in a strong social fabric and civic values. This envisioned future is also one where art is genuinely valued, where social entrepreneurship can flourish, and where technology plays a central role in both individual and collective well-being.

In her talk, Randa focused on the divergence of cultural urbanity to highlight how environments shape distinct modes of existence—yet never in isolation, always conditioned by history, entrenched power structures, and inherited systems of belief. For her, meaningful transformation required the deconstruction of the ego: an unravelling of the self shaped by these external forces. Even memory, she argued, was fractured—the sensory, immediate and unfiltered; the long-term, constructed and selective—each subtly moulding identity, often beneath conscious awareness. Real change, she insisted, could not be superficial or externally imposed; it had to emerge from within, through a confrontation with the deeply layered architectures of culture and self.
