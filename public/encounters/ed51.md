<h4>Summary:</h4>

On 3 July, a stimulating conference and debate was held at the Institut Supérieur de Gestion, organised by Building magazine under the leadership of Michel Taubmann. Moderated by Baki Youssoufou, President of the Student Confederation, the event gathered distinguished speakers, including Frédéric Encel, Antoine Vitkine, Malek Chebbel, Michaël Prazan, and Randa Kassis.

The debate centred on the future of the Arab world in the aftermath of the Arab Spring, with Michel Taubmann posing provocative questions about the consequences of the revolutions and the rise of Islamist movements.

Two broad perspectives emerged:
 - The Pessimistic View, represented by Malek Chebbel and Michaël Prazan, stressed the deep-rooted challenges facing the Arab world. Chebbel pointed to the longstanding fusion of Islam and politics and the enduring effects of colonial destabilisation. Prazan, drawing on his fieldwork in Tunisia and Egypt, warned that the apparent “Facebook youth” were a minority, and that Islamist groups remained the dominant political force.
 - The Optimistic View, defended by Antoine Vitkine and especially Randa Kassis, emphasised that history remains open. Vitkine argued that Islamist dominance would be temporary and that the West retains influence through diplomacy. Randa Kassis offered an inspiring perspective, highlighting the cultural transformation sparked by free expression across Arab societies through digital platforms. She voiced strong confidence that this cultural awakening would, in time, lead to the establishment of genuine democracies.

Despite a modest turnout, the discussion was passionate and insightful, offering a nuanced exploration of one of the most important geopolitical questions of our time.
