<h4>Astana Platform Convenes Seminar on Syria’s Prospective Constitution</h4>

Astana Platform, Geneva  
25-26 March 2017

<b>Summary:</b>

The Astana Platform convened a political seminar in Geneva to explore the foundations of Syria’s future constitution. Chaired by Randa Kassis and attended by legal and constitutional experts, the two-day event produced a series of recommendations aimed at establishing a democratic, inclusive, and pluralistic Syrian state. Key proposals included the adoption of a republican parliamentary system with broad decentralisation, the separation of religion from the state, the recognition of Islamic jurisprudence as one source of legislation, and full adherence to international treaties and humanitarian law. The seminar also emphasised civil liberties, gender equality, cultural and linguistic rights, and the political participation of displaced persons and expatriates. The recommendations will be further examined in Vienna and other capitals in the coming months.
