<h4>Special Focus Syria</h4>

MEDays Forum, Tangier, Morocco  
15 November 2013

<b>Summary:</b>	

Randa Kassis delivered a sharp and pragmatic critique of the Syrian opposition’s strategy at the time. She argued that the Syrian National Coalition had failed to achieve any tangible progress towards resolving the conflict. Rather than providing a realistic pathway to peace, the coalition’s actions, she warned, were merely prolonging the bloodshed and deepening the suffering of the Syrian people.

Emphasising the need for pragmatism over idealism, Kassis called for a political approach grounded in realism, rather than one driven by unattainable demands or rigid ideological positions. Her intervention stood out for its candid assessment of the opposition’s shortcomings and her insistence that ending the violence must take precedence over political posturing.

The panel, moderated by journalist Souad Mekhennet, also included Hasni Abidi, François Burgat, Senen Florensa, and Marc Ellenbogen, each offering their perspectives on the complexities of the Syrian crisis and possible routes forward. However, Kassis’ contribution was distinctive for confronting uncomfortable truths about the opposition’s internal weaknesses and for highlighting the urgent humanitarian need to bring the conflict to an end.
