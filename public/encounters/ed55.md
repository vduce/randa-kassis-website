<h4>The Syrian Revolution: Dictatorship and the Role of Minorities</h4>

La Règle du Jeu, Paris  
8 April 2012  
Speakers: Bernard Guetta, Khalid Issa, Mimi Abdo, Pierre Hasner and Randa Kassis

<b>Summary:</b>

The repression of the Syrian revolution has already claimed over 10,000 officially recorded lives. Many observers are now questioning how this revolution will ultimately conclude: with total failure, or with victory—and if the latter, what form that victory might take. In a country defined by its intricate mosaic of ethnic and religious communities, how will the minorities respond, particularly as many feel increasingly threatened and, in many cases, yearn for only one outcome: to leave the country?
