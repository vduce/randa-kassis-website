Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation (MID), Moscow<br>
6-9 April 2015
	
<b>Summary:</b>	

During a press conference held on the second day of the Moscow II negotiations, Randa Kassis offered a measured assessment of the talks. She observed that the Syrian regime did not appear ready to engage in meaningful agreements at that stage, and cautioned that the current format risked leading to limited progress.

Kassis also noted the challenges facing the opposition, particularly the absence of a clear and coordinated negotiation strategy. In a constructive spirit, she called upon President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan to host a gathering of Syrian opposition groups in Astana, with the objective of developing a unified and pragmatic roadmap for future negotiations.

Her intervention reflected growing frustration with the stagnant dynamics of the talks and emphasised the necessity of greater preparation, internal organisation, and cohesion among opposition forces to achieve meaningful political progress.
