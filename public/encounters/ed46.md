<h4>Summary:</h4>	

Randa Kassis distinguished herself with a lucid and intellectually robust contribution, informed by her longstanding engagement as a political figure and advocate for an inclusive dialogue in the Syrian conflict. She underscored the imperative of a pragmatic and comprehensive political solution, one that fully recognises Syria’s intricate social and ethnic mosaic. Firmly rejecting the notion of abrupt or externally imposed change, Kassis argued that only a gradual, negotiated transition — embracing all components of Syrian society — could pave the way towards genuine and enduring stability.

Turning to Lebanon, she highlighted the profound interdependence between Lebanon’s future and the trajectory of the Syrian crisis, warning that failure to support Syria’s recovery would inevitably reverberate across the entire region. Kassis called upon the international community to adopt a more responsible and forward-looking approach, championing initiatives that foster national reconciliation and sustainable political institutions, rather than succumbing to fleeting geopolitical calculations. Her intervention was marked by its strategic vision, intellectual clarity, and refusal to be drawn into idealistic abstractions detached from the realities on the ground.
