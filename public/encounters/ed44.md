<h4>The Arab Spring and the Christians: An Opportunity or a Threat?</h4>


French Senate, Paris
<br>
13 February 2013, Conference-Debate

	
<h4>Summary:</h4>	

The conference sought to move beyond simplistic narratives, highlighting the diverse political positions of Syrian Christians and their urgent appeal for physical security to remain on their ancestral lands. Speakers, including Bassam Ishak, Said Malki, and Randa Kassis, underlined the precarious position of Christians, caught between a repressive regime and an increasingly Islamist-leaning opposition. Calls were made for greater cultural recognition of the Assyrian-Chaldean-Syriac identity, long suppressed under Ba’athist rule.

While some advocated for military protection for Christian communities, French officials, including Ambassador Eric Chevallier, and Church representatives rejected direct military support, instead encouraging inclusive defence initiatives uniting Christians and Muslims. Randa Kassis argued for a political solution involving the regime, a position the French ambassador opposed.

The conference concluded with a call for the establishment of a parliamentary group in France to advocate for Eastern Christians’ rights, particularly the right to remain on their historic land and to obtain formal ethnic recognition. The event underscored the growing concerns regarding Islamist influence within the opposition and the destabilising role of external actors.
