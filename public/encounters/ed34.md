25-27 May 2015

	
<h4>Summary:</h4>	

The first Astana meeting on Syria was initiated following Randa Kassis’s proposal during a press conference at the Moscow II negotiations. Responding to her call, President Nursultan Nazarbayev agreed to host Syrian opposition groups with the aim of developing a pragmatic and unified roadmap.

Randa Kassis played a central role in shaping the meeting, working alongside the Centre of Political and Foreign Affairs (CPFA) to organise the event. The meeting was officially opened by the Kazakh Foreign Minister, underlining Kazakhstan’s commitment to supporting an inclusive dialogue.

The gathering brought together moderate Syrian opposition figures and concluded with the adoption of the Astana Declaration for a Political Solution in Syria, which called for a gradual political transition, the withdrawal of foreign fighters, and the release of political prisoners.

The Astana I meeting laid the foundations for greater coordination among opposition groups and contributed to broader international efforts to advance peace in Syria.
