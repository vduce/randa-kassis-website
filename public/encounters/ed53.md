<i>Historical Overview</i>

Mr Paillard opened the conference by outlining Syria’s key historical milestones, placing particular emphasis on France’s long-standing role in the region. As the recognised “protector of the Christians of the Levant,” France was entrusted with a mandate over Syria and Lebanon by the League of Nations (the predecessor to the United Nations) following the First World War. This mandate was intended to guide the former Ottoman territories towards eventual independence.

Ms Kassis offered a socio-political perspective, portraying Syria as a mosaic of religious, ethnic, and linguistic identities. The country is home to a rich tapestry of Christian communities—including Syriacs, Nestorians, and Orthodox—as well as a diversity of Islamic sects, such as Sunnis, Shiites, Alawites, Ismailis, and Druze (the latter often deemed heretical, though their roots lie in Islamic doctrine). Ethno-linguistically, Syria encompasses Arabic-speaking Arabs, Indo-European-speaking Kurds, and Turkic-speaking Turkmens.

According to Ms Kassis, the principal cause of the current conflict stems from the Assad regime’s paranoid authoritarianism. Its foreign policy is anchored in three fundamental pillars: unwavering opposition to Israel; rejection of current national borders in favour of reviving the notion of a “Greater Syria”; and a steadfastly anti-Western stance, cultivated through historical alliances with the former Soviet Union, and subsequently with Russia—and at times, China.
