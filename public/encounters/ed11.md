<h4>Syrian National Dialogue Congress </h4>

Russian Federation, Sochi  
30 January 2018

<b>Summary:</b>

The Syrian National Dialogue Congress was organised by the Russian government in coordination with the Astana peace process guarantors—Russia, Iran, and Turkey—with the United Nations attending in an observer capacity. The congress aimed to initiate a Syrian-led political process by bringing together a broad and diverse spectrum of Syrian stakeholders, including representatives of the government, internal and external opposition groups, tribal and religious leaders, and members of civil society.

Randa Kassis, President of the Astana Platform, was invited to participate alongside a delegation representing the Platform, and was appointed as one of ten members of the Presidential Committee established during the congress to oversee the implementation of its outcomes. In her address, Kassis strongly emphasised the formation of a constitutional committee as a critical first step towards a political resolution. She argued that meaningful constitutional reform—carried out with international support—was essential for Syria to rebuild its institutions and move towards lasting peace.

She also underscored the importance of preserving the secular character of the state and called for inclusive dialogue encompassing all components of Syrian society. Despite the absence of several key opposition factions, Kassis defended the congress as a necessary and pragmatic step, criticising those who chose to boycott it for putting external agendas ahead of the Syrian people’s genuine needs.
