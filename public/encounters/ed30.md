<b>Summary:</b>	

Kassis contributed her analysis of the inadequacy of prevailing approaches to combating terrorism, particularly within the context of the Syrian conflict. She emphasised that military solutions alone were insufficient and highlighted the need for inclusive political strategies.

Drawing on the outcomes of Astana II, she reiterated the importance of creating a new Syrian constitution or reforming existing constitutional clauses to enable free and fair elections, considering these measures essential to restoring political stability and undermining the appeal of extremist groups. Kassis underlined that inclusive governance and pragmatic reforms were crucial to addressing the root causes of terrorism and securing a durable peace in the region.

Her intervention at MEDays 2015 reaffirmed her commitment to advocating for practical, inclusive, and political solutions to the challenges facing Syria and the broader Middle East.
