<h4>Summary:</h4>	

Randa Kassis participated in the international conference “Conférence de paix : Parlons-en” at the United Nations headquarters in Geneva. The event brought together diplomats, civil society leaders, and peace advocates to discuss potential pathways towards resolving the Syrian conflict.

In her intervention, Kassis emphasised the need for a pragmatic and inclusive approach to peace negotiations. She highlighted the shortcomings of previous initiatives, particularly the Geneva II Conference, where the exclusion of key secular and moderate opposition groups, including Kurdish representatives, had weakened the credibility and effectiveness of the talks.

Kassis also underlined the importance of engaging influential international actors, notably Russia, stressing that its involvement was essential for exerting pressure on the Assad regime to commit to genuine negotiations. Her contribution reinforced the call for a comprehensive and realistic strategy to achieve a lasting political settlement in Syria.
