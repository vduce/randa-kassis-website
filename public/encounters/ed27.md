<h4>Geneva Intra-Syrian Talks</h4>

United Nations Office at Geneva  
14-24 March 2016  
Second round

<b>Summary:</b>	

The intra-Syrian negotiations, known as the Geneva III talks, commenced on 14 March 2016 in Geneva under the auspices of the United Nations and the facilitation of Special Envoy Staffan de Mistura. The talks aimed to implement the framework established by UN Security Council Resolution 2254, which called for a political transition, the drafting of a new constitution, and the holding of free and fair elections.

Participants included delegations from the Syrian government and various opposition groups, including the Moscow-Cairo opposition platform. Discussions focused on issues such as the political transition, the future governance of Syria, and humanitarian concerns, amidst ongoing violations of the fragile ceasefire established in February 2016.

During this round of negotiations, Randa Kassis, representing the Moscow-Cairo opposition group, called for the reduction of presidential powers in Syria, criticising the concentration of authority within the presidency. She also rejected the legitimacy of the Syrian parliamentary elections scheduled for 13 April 2016, arguing that they undermined the negotiation process and would not be recognised by the international community.

The talks were due to recess on 24 March 2016, with no major breakthrough achieved, although they marked an important attempt to establish a political dialogue among Syrian factions.
