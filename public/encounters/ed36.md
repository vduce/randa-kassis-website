<h4>Moscow I Negotiations on Syria</h4>

Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation (MID), Moscow  
26-29 January 2015
	
<b>Summary:</b>	

These talks were organised by the Russian government with the aim of facilitating dialogue between the Syrian government and various opposition figures. However, the Syrian National Coalition (SNC), the main opposition body recognised by Western countries, boycotted the talks, citing concerns regarding the selection of participants and the agenda.

Randa Kassis, President of the Movement for a Pluralistic Society and a former SNC member, participated in the negotiations. She advocated a pragmatic approach to resolving the Syrian conflict, emphasising the importance of engaging in dialogue with the Syrian government to address the rise of radical Islamist groups and to pave the way for a political solution. Kassis also highlighted the necessity of including secular and moderate opposition voices in the peace process to ensure a comprehensive and representative outcome.
