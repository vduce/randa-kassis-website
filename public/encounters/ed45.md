<b>Summary:</b>	

Randa Kassis drew attention to the fragmented nature of the opposition, observing the presence of various elements not aligned with the original revolt, including Islamist factions.

She underscored the significant influence of external actors, particularly Qatar, which she described as exerting considerable power over developments in Syria.

Kassis further discussed the roles of Russia and Iran in supporting the Assad regime, suggesting that Iran’s involvement was motivated by strategic interests aimed at curbing Sunni influence in the region.

She noted that Iran was providing military training to young Syrians and offering counsel to President Bashar al-Assad, although he did not always act upon the advice given.

Kassis concluded by questioning the future trajectory of Iran’s role in Syria and the broader implications for regional stability.
