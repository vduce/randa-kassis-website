<h4>Authoritarianism in Syria</h4>

5th Annual Geneva Summit for Human Rights and Democracy, Geneva  
19 February 2013
	
<b>Summary:</b>	

Randa Kassis drew attention to the fragmented nature of the opposition, observing the presence of various elements not aligned with the original revolt, including Islamist factions.

She underscored the significant influence of external actors, particularly Qatar, which she described as exerting considerable power over developments in Syria.

Kassis further discussed the roles of Russia and Iran in supporting the A25ssad regime, suggesting that Iran’s involvement was motivated by strategic interests aimed at curbing Sunni influence in the region.

She noted that Iran was providing military training to young Syrians and offering counsel to President Bashar al-Assad, although he did not always act upon the advice given.

Kassis concluded by questioning the future trajectory of Iran’s role in Syria and the broader implications for regional stability.
