<h4>The Roots and Causes of Islamic Violence: Secularism as the Solution</h4>

ADHOC Organisation, Brussels  
22 May 2016

<b>Summary:</b>	

The first conference of the ADHOC organisation was held in Brussels in May 2016, under the presidency of Randa Kassis, co-founder and president of the initiative. Bringing together a broad spectrum of Arab intellectuals, writers, and secular activists, the event sought to explore the roots of religious violence and to assert secularism as a fundamental pillar of democratic reform in the Arab world.

Among the most resonant contributions were those of the distinguished Syrian poet Adonis and the eminent Egyptian scholar Sayyid Al Qemani. Together, they offered a profound and uncompromising critique of the religious and institutional foundations that have long perpetuated authoritarianism and hindered intellectual progress in the region.

Adonis reflected on the cultural and philosophical dimensions of religious violence, arguing that meaningful transformation must begin with an unflinching reassessment of sacred texts and the deeply entrenched thought systems that define Arab identity. In parallel, Al Qemani examined how religious institutions have historically served to entrench political power, stifle dissent, and suppress individual freedoms. Both thinkers converged in their insistence on the urgent need to dismantle inherited dogmas and challenge sacred taboos.

Their interventions reaffirmed a shared conviction: that secularism is not merely a political framework but an intellectual and moral imperativeâ€”essential for fostering genuine pluralism, civil peace, and a modern Arab cultural identity rooted in critical thought and humanist values.
