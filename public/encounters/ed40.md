<h4>Randa Kassis’s Meeting with UN Envoy Lakhdar Brahimi</h4>

United Nations Office at Geneva<br>
18 December 2013
	
<h4>Summary:</h4>	

In preparation for the 2014 Geneva II Conference on Syria, Randa Kassis met with Lakhdar Brahimi, the United Nations and Arab League Special Envoy. During their discussion, Kassis emphasised that the negotiations should not be limited to the Syrian National Coalition, which had failed to represent the full diversity of the Syrian opposition. She strongly advocated for the inclusion of other prominent secular groups, including Kurdish representatives, to ensure a broader and more credible delegation.

Kassis also underlined the critical role of Russia, noting its significant influence over the Assad regime. She stressed that Russia’s involvement would be essential to exert meaningful pressure on Damascus and to encourage serious engagement in the negotiations. Her intervention highlighted the necessity of both inclusive Syrian representation and the constructive participation of key international actors to give the Geneva talks the best chance of success.
