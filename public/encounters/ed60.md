<h4>Summary:</h4>	

The session opened with remarks by Ms Randa Kassis, a Syrian anthropologist and journalist, who offered a compelling analysis of the collective psyche of the Muslim world. She stated: “It was naïve to believe that despotic and corrupt regimes could serve as a bulwark against Islamism… On the contrary, the intellectual void left by these regimes, coupled with their vilification of thinkers, pushed intellectuals into elitist enclaves, while society at large continued to suffer from poverty and corruption. In reality, these autocratic regimes paved the way for Islamists, who devoted considerable effort to grassroots social initiatives.”

Kassis argued that, over time, Arabo-Islamism came to replace national pan-Arabism in the collective consciousness: “Every Muslim individual carries within them the weight of the Arab world’s repeated failures. In societies grappling with identity crises, Islamism has come to embody the accumulated frustrations and resentment towards ruling regimes. Feeling abandoned and betrayed, many Muslims have increasingly turned to God, clinging to the illusion that they are His beloved.”

She further highlighted the role of the West, asserting that “the West’s double standards have only exacerbated the phenomenon.” By supporting despotic regimes, she argued, Western nations compromised the very values they claimed to defend. She concluded with a clear warning and a call to action: “The West must be willing to take risks and support the movements now emerging. But it must do so while remaining vigilant and true to its principles—Islamism must not be allowed to spill over into the lands of liberty.”

Mezri Haddad, Tunisia’s ambassador to UNESCO, who resigned on the same morning President Ben Ali fled, echoed her concerns. He pointed to the stated position of Tunisia’s Islamist party, Ennahda, which had announced it would not field a presidential candidate, calling it possibly a calculated manoeuvre akin to the Iranian precedent: “The Iranian model”. “Khomeini, after all, also refused the presidency, choosing instead the role of ‘Supreme Leader’, a post above any elected official.”

Haddad was unequivocal: “Islamism is a theocratic ideology and, by definition, inherently totalitarian.” As a philosopher and author of numerous works on political thought, he urged caution and vigilance. He also dismissed any comparison with Turkey’s so-called model of moderate Islam: “Such a model only emerged in Turkey because of its entrenched tradition of secularism established by Atatürk.” “If we genuinely wish to prevent an Islamist drift in Tunisia, we must start by enshrining the separation of religion and politics in the Constitution.”

He concluded by reminding the audience: “I had been the first opponent, as early as 1989, of the ousted Tunisian president’s regime.”

The discussion was further enriched by the perspectives of two seasoned journalists. Ahmed Youssef, Paris correspondent for Al Ahram, described the sweeping changes across the Arab world as: “A miracle, a gift from the heavens.”

By contrast, Taoufik Mjaied, of France 24, expressed scepticism regarding religious discourse as a political framework, stating: “Religious discourse is incapable of producing a viable political programme”—and thus claimed to be “not especially concerned.”

Youssef concluded with a striking remark on Egypt’s political trajectory: “In other words, Islamists are likely to find their way into Egypt’s political arena and corridors of power.”
