<h4>Syria at a Crossroads: Advocating for Secularism, Pluralism, and Political Dialogue</h4>

Youth Diplomacy, Paris<br>
10 October 2013

<h4>Summary:</h4>	

Randa Kassis addressed a youth diplomacy forum in Paris, offering a clear and uncompromising analysis of the Syrian crisis. Fiercely opposed to any form of religious interference in public affairs, she warned that political Islam hinders individual freedoms and impedes the prospects for a modern, pluralistic Syria.

While maintaining a firm stance against extremists, Kassis acknowledged the possibility of compromise with “moderate Islamists” who, in her view, pursued their aims through different, less violent methods. However, she emphasised that the deeper malaise lay in the fractured social fabric of Syria itself, lamenting that “Syrians have never truly loved one another.”

Addressing the international debate over military intervention, Kassis expressed understanding for Syrians desperate for an end to Assad’s rule, but warned against the dangers of foreign military action. She conceded that limited, targeted strikes might exert pressure and revive political dialogue, yet she cautioned that the risks of escalation, retaliation, and even regional war were dangerously high. In the absence of certainty about the consequences, she firmly opposed military intervention, arguing instead for political solutions that would prevent Syria’s further disintegration.

Her intervention was a call for realism, secularism, and dialogue — a vision that sought to protect Syria’s diversity while avoiding the devastating spiral of violence that unchecked intervention might unleash.
