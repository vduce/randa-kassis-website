<h4>From Failing to Rebooting States</h4>
MEDays, Tangier, Morocco
<br>
8-11 November 2017  

<b>Summary:</b>

During the 2017 MEDays Forum in Tangier, Randa Kassis participated in the panel discussion titled “From Failing to Rebooting States”, contributing to a high-level debate on the challenges confronting fragile and post-conflict nations.

Drawing on her political experience and involvement in the Syrian peace process, Kassis provided a nuanced analysis of the structural and geopolitical factors that sustain state fragility. She highlighted the imperative of pragmatic and inclusive dialogue—particularly with key international stakeholders—as a cornerstone for rebuilding national institutions and promoting durable governance. She also stressed the importance of involving local actors and civil society in any recovery strategy, cautioning against top-down approaches imposed from abroad that often fail to reflect the realities on the ground.

The panel explored broader themes including the role of foreign intervention, the shortcomings of externally driven democratisation efforts, and the need to address deep-seated social and economic grievances. Examples from various regions were discussed to illustrate both the successes and failures of past reconstruction efforts.
