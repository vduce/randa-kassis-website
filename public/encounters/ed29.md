<h4>Geneva Intra-Syrian Talks</h4>

London United Nations Office at Geneva  
29 January-5 February 2016  
First Round

<b>Summary:</b>	

The first round of the Geneva intra-Syrian talks opened on 29 January 2016 under the auspices of the United Nations and Special Envoy Staffan de Mistura, based on UN Security Council Resolution 2254 (2015).

Substantive discussions were delayed by procedural issues and a lack of progress on urgent humanitarian measures. Alongside the Syrian government and the High Negotiations Committee (HNC), representatives of the Astana Platform and the Moscow Platform also participated, advocating for pragmatic political solutions and constitutional reforms.

On 3 February 2016, the Special Envoy announced a recess to begin on 5 February, with talks expected to resume no later than 25 February 2016. De Mistura stressed that negotiations must deliver tangible benefits to the Syrian people and reaffirmed that humanitarian relief remained the United Nationsâ€™ top priority. He also called on the International Syria Support Group (ISSG) to address humanitarian concerns and to prepare for a proposed nationwide ceasefire ahead of the next round of talks.
