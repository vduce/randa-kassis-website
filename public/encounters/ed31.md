<h4>Astana II Meeting on Syria</h4>

Rixos Hotel, Astana<br>
2-4 October 2015
	
<b>Summary:</b>	


The second Astana Conference on Syria, organised by the Centre of Political and Foreign Affairs (CPFA) in collaboration with the Kazakh authorities, built upon the earlier Kazakhstan Peace Talks initiated by Randa Kassis.

Kassis played a central role in promoting the continuation of dialogue, having called upon President Nursultan Nazarbayev to deepen Kazakhstan’s engagement in supporting a pragmatic resolution to the Syrian conflict.

The meeting brought together moderate Syrian opposition figures who worked to refine a political roadmap, focusing on constitutional reforms, the drafting of a new constitution, and preparations for free and fair elections, open to all citizens, whether residing within Syria or abroad. It was further agreed to introduce new reforms, or amend existing constitutional clauses, that impede fair electoral processes, to establish a new negotiating committee, and to intensify efforts to combat terrorism.

During the conference, Randa Kassis emphasised the urgent need to secure the release of prisoners held by terrorist groups, a matter not previously addressed during Astana I.

The outcome of Astana II reaffirmed the principles set out in the original Astana Declaration and further consolidated the Astana Platform’s role in subsequent peace initiatives, including contributions to the Geneva discussions.
