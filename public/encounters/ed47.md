<h4>Summary:</h4>	

During the panel addressing the geopolitical crises in Syria and the Sahel, Randa Kassis voiced strong reservations regarding the militarisation of the Syrian conflict. She cautioned that the growing influence of Islamist factions within the opposition posed a significant threat to any future political transition. Kassis was critical of the Free Syrian Army, arguing that its fragmented structure and the mercenary-like mentality of many of its fighters rendered it incapable of overcoming Assad’s regime. She stressed that the opposition’s lack of a coherent political vision, coupled with the dominance of Islamist agendas, jeopardised the prospect of a democratic and stable Syria. Kassis urged the international community to exercise greater caution in supporting armed groups without a clear and inclusive political framework, warning of the risk of replacing one form of despotism with another, cloaked in religious extremism.
