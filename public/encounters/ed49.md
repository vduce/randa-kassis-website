<b>Summary:</b>	

During the MEDEF Summer University session “Too Much or Not Enough Authority,” Randa Kassis, Syrian politician and secular opposition figure, delivered a particularly striking intervention. She warned that even if Bashar al-Assad were to fall immediately, Syria’s crisis would persist. Kassis underlined the deep-rooted political, ethnic, and religious divisions within Syrian society, stressing that without the establishment of a robust and inclusive political framework, the country risked descending into prolonged chaos and sectarian violence. She criticised the overly optimistic narrative prevalent in the West, which assumed that Assad’s removal would lead swiftly to democracy, urging instead a more realistic and measured approach. Her intervention resonated with the session’s broader theme, highlighting the crucial need for strong yet legitimate authority to prevent further disintegration.
