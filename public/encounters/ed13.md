<h4>Astana Political Platform Organises Meetings on Syrian Constitution and De-escalation Zones</h4>

Astana Platform, Geneva  
11-12 July 2017

<b>Summary:</b>

The Astana Political Platform, in cooperation with the French Centre for Political and Foreign Affairs, convened its second seminar on the Syrian constitution, entitled “The Future Syrian Constitution”, in Geneva, Switzerland. The event was held in parallel with the United Nations-sponsored intra-Syrian peace talks, led by the UN Special Envoy, Staffan de Mistura.

The first day began with an opening address by Randa Kassis, President of the Astana Political Platform. The initial session, “The Constitution and the State: Between Federalism and Enhanced Decentralisation”, set the stage for an in-depth exploration of governance structures suitable for Syria’s future.

The second session, “The Constitution and the State: Between Federalism and Enhanced Decentralisation – Part 2”, featured contributions from former Turkish Foreign Minister Yaşar Yakış, former Italian Foreign Minister Giulio Terzi, French constitutional expert Professor Xavier Latour, and former French diplomat Jean-Louis Gergorin.

The seminar concluded with the final session, “The Constitution and the Distribution of Powers – Part 2”, which once again brought together Yakış, Terzi, Latour, and Gergorin for further discussion.

The seminar ended with a number of key recommendations. Foremost among them was that Syrians themselves should draft their future constitution; that a mixed presidential-parliamentary system should be adopted; that the constitution must clearly define the structure of the state; that it should protect the fundamental components of national identity—ethnic, religious, and cultural; that powers should be distributed equitably and transparently; and that the constitution must guarantee the empowerment of women within both society and governance.
