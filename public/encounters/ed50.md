<h4>Summary:</h4>	

Randa Kassis, participated in the third meeting of the Group of Friends of the Syrian People, convened at the Ministerial Conference Centre in Paris, France. At that time, she served as a member of the Syrian National Council and as President of the Coalition of Secular and Democratic Syrians, a Paris-based organisation advocating for a secular and democratic Syria. The conference aimed to coordinate international support for the Syrian opposition amidst the escalating civil conflict. Although detailed records of Kassis’s specific contributions to the proceedings are limited, her participation underscored her prominent role within the opposition movement. Later in 2012, Kassis was excluded from the Syrian National Council after voicing concerns regarding the increasing influence of Islamist groups within the opposition. She subsequently founded the Movement for a Pluralistic Society in October 2012, advancing a vision of a secular, democratic, and inclusive Syria.
