<h4>Summary:</h4>	

Is the Arab world today witnessing a wave of democratisation or one of Islamisation? Can the nascent democracies emerging in post-revolutionary states overcome the polarisation between secular and Islamist forces? And what, if any, common ground exists between the newly dominant Islamist parties — such as Ennahda in Tunisia, the Freedom and Justice Party in Egypt, and the Justice and Development Party in Morocco — and the opposition parties, most of which align with modernist and secular ideals?

To explore these pressing questions, the Arab Reform Initiative organised a two-day conference in Tunis on 11–12 March, featuring a series of high-level debates. These discussions brought together political activists, academics, and media figures, with each debate pairing a representative from an Islamist current with a counterpart from a secular or modernist background, drawn from Tunisia, Egypt, Syria, and Morocco.

A Wave of Democratisation or a Wave of Islamisation?

A number of participants questioned whether the Arab uprisings should be viewed as part of a broader democratic wave or as a turn towards Islamisation. Professor Asma Nouira, for example, asked whether the region is truly embracing the mechanisms of democracy and working to entrench them, or whether the revolutions have side-lined such concerns, reducing political discourse to questions of identity and a nostalgic return to foundational sources.

In response, Ajmi Lourimi of Tunisia’s Ennahda movement emphasised the need to transition from Islamisation to democratisation. He called for a definitive end to exclusion, regardless of ideological or political orientation, declaring that the public space must remain open to all — a historic and civilisational gain.

The Challenge of Polarisation between Secularists and Islamists

Several speakers, including journalist Salah Eddine Jorshi, warned of the dangers posed by increasing polarisation between secular and Islamist factions, which they argued undermines the democratic transition. Reflecting on the Tunisian elections post-revolution, Jorshi pointed out that certain secular parties made grave errors by engaging in confrontations framed in religious and ideological terms — confrontations that Islamists were able to exploit by portraying themselves as defenders of Islam under threat.

Lourimi echoed this concern, urging that the divide between religious and modernist currents be softened. The priority, he said, should be establishing a truly democratic system, ensuring genuine political pluralism, and safeguarding rights and freedoms for all citizens.

Syrian activist Louay Safi added that the success of the democratic transition ultimately hinges on the ability of intellectual and cultural elites to transcend polarisation and division.

The Crisis of Mutual Mistrust

Another key theme was the evident intellectual gulf — or lack of common ground — between several participants. This prompted Professor Amal Grami to describe the situation as a “crisis of mutual mistrust” among political actors. She stressed the need to dispel these suspicions in order to facilitate meaningful dialogue, questioning whether such mistrust is deeply embedded in the region’s historical and cultural heritage.

In this context, Louay Safi criticised what he described as the “political Machiavellianism” displayed by some parties, particularly secular ones, whom he accused of enabling corruption. Ajmi Lourimi, meanwhile, criticised the opposition for playing a purely reactive role, limited to slogans and devoid of constructive proposals or viable alternatives.

Supporting the notion of entrenched mistrust, Egyptian researcher Ibrahim El-Houdaiby observed that some leftist actors continue to show disdain for Islamists — an attitude he likened to a lingering colonial mindset. He argued that it is the region’s corrupt elites who are ultimately obstructing national progress.

From Violent Rhetoric to Intellectual Engagement

Salam Kawakibi, Director of the Arab Reform Initiative, stressed the importance of initiating genuine dialogue on divisive issues before tensions erupt. Echoing this call, writer and President of the League of Secularists in Syria, Randa Kassis, argued for a fundamental shift from rhetoric rooted in hostility to a discourse anchored in thought and reason. She urged that the values of freedom, knowledge, creativity, diversity, and acceptance of the other be given paramount importance, emphasising that all citizens, regardless of background, are partners in the nation — and that no party has the right to dominate or marginalise another. For Kassis, the highest human goal is to break the chains that stifle creativity in its fullest and freest sense.

Preventing the Reproduction of Authoritarianism

Addressing the role of the opposition in democratic transitions, Salah Eddine Jorshi underscored the necessity of a strong and constructive opposition to avoid a return to authoritarian rule. By contrast, Abdessamad Sekkal of Morocco’s ruling Justice and Development Party argued that the monarchy is the guarantor of stability, lamenting the opposition’s refusal to engage in dialogue. In sharp contrast, journalist Ali Anouzla maintained that Morocco’s political transformation is still in its early stages, and that — for the first time — the street has emerged as a formidable negotiating force, stronger than any formal opposition.

Turning to Syria, Salam Kawakibi noted that the opposition initially extended a hand to the regime, which rejected all overtures and persisted with a campaign of arrests and violence, effectively closing off any avenue for genuine reform. He concluded by stressing the importance of the various opposition factions within the Syrian National Council developing a coherent political programme for the domestic arena as a means of moving beyond the current crisis.
