<b>Summary:</b>

The Russian Foreign Ministry announced on Friday, that Mikhail Bogdanov, Deputy Foreign Minister and Special Presidential Envoy for the Middle East and North Africa, held a series of meetings in Moscow with representatives of the Syrian opposition.

Bogdanov met separately with Qadri Jamil, Randa Kassis, Jihad Makdissi, and Jamal Suleiman, and later conducted a round of joint consultations with them.

According to the statement, the discussions focused on advancing a political settlement to the Syrian conflict. The participants emphasised the urgent need to initiate an inclusive intra-Syrian dialogue, based on the Geneva Communiqué of 30 June 2012, relevant UN Security Council resolutions, and the declarations of the International Syria Support Group. They affirmed that such a dialogue could bring an end to the armed confrontation in Syria and help ease the deep societal divisions that have developed over the years.

It was further stressed that the key policy positions adopted by the main Syrian opposition groups should complement one another to form a common negotiating platform—one that aims to preserve Syria as a sovereign, secular, and unified state in which all citizens enjoy equal rights, regardless of ethnic or religious affiliation.
