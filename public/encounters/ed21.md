<h4>Summary:</h4>

The Centre for Political and Foreign Affairs (CPFA) hosted a high-level roundtable in Paris, bringing together prominent political and intellectual figures for a confidential discussion on the future of Syria and broader Middle Eastern dynamics. Held under the Chatham House Rule, the event featured the 11th President of Turkey, Abdullah Gül, alongside Syrian opposition leader Randa Kassis and the renowned Syrian poet and thinker Adonis.

The meeting took place at a critical moment in the Syrian conflict, amid escalating regional instability and faltering diplomatic efforts. President Gül voiced serious concerns about Syria’s trajectory, warning that the country risked becoming a long-term haven for extremist groups if the crisis remained unresolved. He criticised the international community for its inadequate response and urged more concerted efforts to bring the conflict to an end.

Participants underscored the urgent need for a negotiated political settlement—one that would prioritise inclusive intra-Syrian dialogue, regional cooperation, and the safeguarding of Syria’s sovereignty. The importance of upholding secular governance and guaranteeing equal rights for all citizens, regardless of ethnic or religious background, emerged as a central theme throughout the discussion. The roundtable reflected CPFA’s ongoing commitment to fostering open, multidimensional dialogue among influential regional actors and thinkers.
