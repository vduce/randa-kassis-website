<h4>The Creation of a Secular Syrian Opposition Movement</h4>

Palais des Congrès, Paris  
6–7 September 2011

<b>Summary:</b>	

After the meeting of the Preparatory Committee of the Syrian Secular Coalition in Bonn on 20 June 2011, the participants agreed to hold a conference in Paris on the 7th and 8th of September, which would serve as the founding meeting of the Syrian Secular Democratic Coalition against Bashar al-Assad.

Randa blamed the threat of an Islamist government for the limited involvement of minority groups such as Christians and Kurds in the revolution. “Islamist rule is a real danger,” she told FRANCE 24. “That is why religious minorities are cautious about participating in the uprising. However, they must join forces to overthrow the Assad regime.”
