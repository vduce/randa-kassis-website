<h4>Confronting the Roots of Conflict: Randa Kassis’ 2017 Intervention in Italy</h4>

Rome, Milan & Bologna  
February-March 2017

<b>Summary:</b>

Between February and March 2017, Randa Kassis delivered a series of talks across Italy, including at the Averroes Institute in Rome, Palazzo Perrelli in Milan, and events in Bologna. She addressed Syria’s transformation into the epicentre of a globalised conflict—one that pits democrats against both nationalist dictatorships and Islamist fundamentalists.

Alongside French essayist Alexandre del Valle, Kassis offered a historical and social analysis that departed from moralistic and Manichaean narratives. They criticised the West’s support for Islamist forces during the Arab Spring, which swiftly descended into an 'Islamist winter', and argued that a lasting solution for Syria must be grounded in pragmatic dialogue—one that includes Russia, viewed not only as part of the problem but also as part of the solution.

They further warned that the West’s greatest strategic error has been its persistent refusal to confront Islamist totalitarianism as the central threat. This ideology wages war not only through acts of terrorism, but also via a calculated, transnational campaign of proselytisation—often backed by Gulf regimes paradoxically treated as allies. For too long, Western societies have allowed radical Islamist networks to infiltrate and exert influence over communities, weakened by political correctness and a misplaced sense of historical guilt.
