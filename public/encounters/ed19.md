<h4>The Right of Blasphemy: No to Medieval Trials</h4>

ADHOC Organisation, Rome  
30 October 2016

<b>Summary:</b>

ADHOC held its second international conference in Rome, entitled “The Right to Blasphemy”, once again chaired by its co-founder and president, Randa Kassis. The event brought together a diverse group of Arab intellectuals, writers, secular activists, and reformists from across the region and the diaspora to assert the right to challenge religious dogma—an essential pillar of freedom of expression in any democratic society.

Among the participants were prominent figures such as Hamed Abdel-Samad and Said Nashed, alongside many others who contributed to a rich and critical dialogue. Discussions centred on the political, cultural, and legal ramifications of blasphemy laws in the Arab world, which have long served as instruments of repression, used to silence dissent and hinder reform.

Speakers collectively called for the abolition of these laws and for the defence of secular principles as a means to safeguard pluralism, individual freedoms, and open intellectual exchange. The conference reaffirmed ADHOC’s commitment to challenging entrenched taboos and promoting secularism as a foundation for genuine societal transformation.
