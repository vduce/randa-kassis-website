Spreading the Ideas and Aims of the Spring: Technology, Media and Social Media
This session will explore the role of media during the Arab Spring. A comparison between news agencies such as Al Jazeera and the state-backed SANA may offer insights into the media’s evolving role within the Arab world. The outcomes of social media as a catalyst will also be discussed.

Discussion points include:

 - What is the role of social media in fostering solidarity and its social power in demanding change within societies?
 - What are the risks and benefits of using social media and other modern communication technologies to maintain global and regional stability?
 - Can the media act as a catalyst in supporting democratic transitions in the region?
 - Does social media provide opportunities for surveillance by authoritarian regimes?
 - Is social media use consistent with the principles of political participation?
 - Has the rapid emergence of change facilitated by social media jeopardised sustainability in these countries?
 - How can we ensure media freedom and independence?
