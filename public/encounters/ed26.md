<h4>Geneva Intra-Syrian Talks</h4>

United Nations Office at Geneva<br>
13-27 April 2016<br>
Third round
	
<b>Summary:</b>	

The talks aimed to advance discussions on the formation of a transitional governing body, the drafting of a new constitution, and preparations for free and fair elections. Delegations included representatives of the Syrian government, the High Negotiations Committee (HNC), the Moscow Platform, and the Astana Platform. The presence of the Moscow and Astana groups reinforced calls for pragmatic reforms and highlighted the need for an inclusive political transition.

Despite intensive consultations, substantive progress remained limited due to fundamental disagreements over the future role of the presidency and a resurgence of violence on the ground. Nevertheless, Special Envoy Staffan de Mistura continued to emphasise the importance of pursuing constitutional reform and national reconciliation as essential pillars of any sustainable political settlement.

The third round formally recessed on 27 April 2016, with further talks anticipated, though no definitive breakthrough was achieved.
