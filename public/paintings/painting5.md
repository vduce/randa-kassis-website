<center><h4>5. Celestial Fragments over Dunes</h4></center>

<br/>

This small collection reflects a moment where the cosmic and the earthly intersect—a surreal desert landscape over which floating geometric fragments rise like echoes of thought or memory ascending into the unknown. The dunes below evoke the timeless stillness of the desert, while the planetary sky pulls the gaze upwards into vastness.
The suspended forms are not meteors—they are metaphysical artefacts, broken pieces of a once-whole self. This painting captures a liminal state: between form and dissolution, earth and ether, solitude and transcendence. It is a meditation on fragmentation, on belonging nowhere and everywhere at once.
