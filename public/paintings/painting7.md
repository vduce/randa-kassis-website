<center><h4>7. Totems and Emotional Cartographies</h4></center>
<br/>

These paintings were born in the volatile silence of my twenties—a time when identity had not yet solidified, and expression was not a choice but a necessity. The horse became my totem—untamed, instinctual, always on the verge of flight. Faces fractured, distorted, screamed—mirroring the fragmentation within me. Mothers appeared as myths, bathed in spectral light, symbols of both origin and distance.

Colour was not aesthetic; it was emotional cartography. Every brushstroke held a question. Every distortion was a truth I could not yet articulate in words. These works are not declarations—they are raw confessions of a soul wrestling with form, memory, and silence.
