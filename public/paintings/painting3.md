<center><h4>3. States of Mind and Memory</h4></center>

<br/>

These paintings delve into the raw interiority of human experience—conflict, fracture, madness, and the deep imprints of familial bonds. They represent a psychological shift in my work, where the body and mind collapse into one another, becoming contorted, abstracted, and exposed.
The man gripping his head in anguish is not simply suffering—he is unravelling. The fused figures speak to symbiosis and silence. And the mother and child, cloaked in swirls of colour, capture the chaos of memory—how closeness and rupture coexist within love. These are not portraits. They are states of being, caught in the act of disintegration or rebirth.
