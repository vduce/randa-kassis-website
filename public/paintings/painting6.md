6. Desert Echoes – A Journey Through the Nomad’s Mind
<br/>

These paintings emerged during my earliest exhibitions in the Gulf, where the desert, more than a place, revealed itself as a state of mind. I was captivated—not by the romanticised vision of endless dunes, but by the silence, the austerity, and the rawness the desert imposes.
The figures—camel riders, lone horsemen, hands pouring tea—reflect solitude, dignity, and a way of being shaped by elemental forces. The desert may seem still, but beneath its rituals and silences lies the spirit of the conqueror. It carves its people from wind and will.
Loving the desert is not about idealising it, but recognising its tension—between barrenness and vision, stillness and movement. The swirling colours in the background of these works are not just landscapes—they are mental geographies of the nomad: scattered, wild, but composed by necessity.
