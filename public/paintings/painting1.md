<center><h4>1. Acts of the Body – Resistance in Flesh</h4></center>

<br/>
My paintings of the female body stand in defiance of how Middle Eastern societies define it—with taboos, shame, honour, and the ever-present myth of the hymen. In this region, a woman’s body is haunted by laws, legends, and invisible hands that begin shaping her even before birth. Through my work, I aim to redraw these bodies—nude, faceless, fragmented, yet powerful—liberated from the narratives imposed by tribe, religion, or man.
These are not simply nudes. They are acts of desecration—of the hymen, of modesty, of the obedient silhouette. I place the body back at the centre, surrounded by a shattered world: a chaos of stained glass, a map of broken borders and fractured beliefs. My women do not ask to be seen—they demand to be accepted as they are: beings of flesh, rage, sensuality, and thought. This is not beauty—it is rupture. It is confrontation. It is my way of saying: we will not be veiled in art, nor in life.

The naked female body in my paintings is neither an object of desire nor a symbol of shame. It is a battlefield. A site of memory, pleasure, rebellion, and reclaiming. In a region where women’s bodies are hidden, judged, legislated, and mythologised, I choose to expose them—not to please, but to confront. Stripped of names and faces, my women are not anonymous but universal. Their nudity is not vulnerability—it is power, unfiltered. These bodies do not whisper; they howl.

These paintings portray more than bodily confinement—they expose the deeper captivity of identity and desire under cultural surveillance. In many Middle Eastern contexts, the body becomes both threat and spectacle. The barred figures suggest not just physical constraint, but internalised repression—a woman taught to censor herself. The droplets evoke sorrow and suppression, yet the body endures: fragmented, luminous, and defiant in its visibility.
