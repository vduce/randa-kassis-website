1. Acts of the Body – Resistance in Flesh
   
My paintings of the female body stand in defiance of how Middle Eastern societies define it—with taboos, shame, honour, and the ever-present myth of the hymen. In this region, a woman’s body is haunted by laws, legends, and invisible hands that begin shaping her even before birth. Through my work, I aim to redraw these bodies—nude, faceless, fragmented, yet powerful—liberated from the narratives imposed by tribe, religion, or man.
These are not simply nudes. They are acts of desecration—of the hymen, of modesty, of the obedient silhouette. I place the body back at the centre, surrounded by a shattered world: a chaos of stained glass, a map of broken borders and fractured beliefs. My women do not ask to be seen—they demand to be accepted as they are: beings of flesh, rage, sensuality, and thought. This is not beauty—it is rupture. It is confrontation. It is my way of saying: we will not be veiled in art, nor in life.
