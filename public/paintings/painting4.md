<center><h4>4. The Universe – A Return to Nothingness</h4></center>

<br/>

I painted these works at various moments in my twenties, using both oil and acrylic to explore the universe not as a place of life, but as a space beyond it. To me, the universe is freedom—a vast expanse where our atoms and electrons drift after death, free from the burden of the “I.” It is a realm of total peace, where inexistence is no longer feared but embraced.
The universe, to me, is a return—a return to a state before birth, before thought, before form. It is where mystery exists without the need for answers. In that silence, in that immensity, life as we know it fades into fragments of energy, still moving, still present, yet no longer owned.
When I frame the universe with broken bars or fractured structures, I am expressing the fragile nature of life. Our existence is brief, and death shatters it. What comes after? Nothing but scattered fragments—echoes of electrons floating freely in the cosmos. I do not paint to preserve life. I paint to honour what comes after: not death, but the quiet dissolution into something greater, and infinitely free.
