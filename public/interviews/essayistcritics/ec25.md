<h4>The Irish Church and Child Sexual Abuse Scandals</h4>

France 24  
17 February 2010  
Presented by Adel Gastel.  
Guests: Marie Keyrouz and Randa Kassis 

<b>Summary:</b>

This episode of France 24 examined the child sexual abuse scandal that shook the Irish Catholic Church and provoked global outrage. It focused on the Vatican’s response—particularly Pope Benedict XVI’s meeting with Irish bishops—and the broader institutional failures that allowed abuse to continue for decades. Sister Marie Keyrouz, representing a voice from within the Church, expressed deep sorrow and called for genuine reform rooted in Christian ethics and pastoral care. She urged a distinction between the faith’s core values and the crimes of individual clergy.

In contrast, Randa Kassis delivered a sharp critique of the Church’s power structures, arguing that systemic silence and unchecked clerical authority had enabled abuse. She stressed the need for independant oversight and a re-evaluation of the Church’s moral authority in secular societies.

The discussion raised important questions about whether the Vatican’s apology was a true reckoning or a strategic effort to protect its image. Both participants agreed on the urgent need to prioritise victims and place child protection at the centre of institutional reform. The episode offered a sober reflection on the convergence of religion, power, and justice, highlighting the need for transparency and accountability in all moral institutions.
