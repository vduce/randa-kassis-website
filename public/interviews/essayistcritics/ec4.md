<h4>Arab Freethinkers United Against the Violence of Islam</h4>

La Verita  
29 October 2016  

Tomorrow in Rome, from 9:30 a.m. to 2:00 p.m., the international conference The Right to Blasphemy: No to Medieval Trials will take place at the Hotel Nazionale, Piazza Monte Citorio 131. The event is organised by the association Ad Hoc, in collaboration with Una Via per Oriana, chaired by Armando Manocchia.

Randa Kassis, founder of Ad Hoc, and intellectual Alexandre del Valle have written the following exchange for La Verità, addressing the central themes of the forthcoming Roman conference.

<b>Del Valle: Randa, your foundation is convening an international conference in Rome tomorrow on the provocative theme of “The Right to Blasphemy.” Several prominent Arab intellectuals—liberal, reformist, or branded as ‘apostates’, many of whom face persecution or death threats, will be in attendance. What message do you hope to convey?</b>

Kassis: The organisation Ad Hoc, which I chair, identifies as secular, modernist, and pluralist. It is an international NGO headquartered in London, with branches in several countries. Our aim is to promote a modern civic culture in the Middle East and North Africa—one rooted in free thought, tolerance, and pluralism.

Naturally, one of our principal goals is to support the development of progressive civil societies in which religion is separated from politics, in order to prevent the abuses and discrimination often justified in the name of “culture”.

As for tomorrow’s conference, its primary aim is to protest against Islamic laws which—under the pretext of “defending the honour of Islam” and combating blasphemy, apostasy, or “offences” against the faith—are used to suppress religious and intellectual freedom, along with the right to freedom of conscience—employing fear and repression as instruments of control.

<b>Del Valle: Could you provide some concrete examples?</b>

Kassis: Take the case of Asia Bibi, a poor Christian mother in Pakistan, sentenced to death for alleged blasphemy and left to languish in prison for years in a state of constant fear.

Countless others—Christians, Druze, Sufis, free thinkers, secularists, progressives, minorities, and intellectuals—face imprisonment, persecution, murder, condemnation, or social ostracism under the same guise.

While the phrase “right to blasphemy” may offend some Italian Catholics—and I understand why—it is not about promoting disrespect towards religion. Rather, it is a response to the persecution of free thinkers who are too often silenced by blasphemy accusations.

This accusation has become a rallying cry for radical Islamists—whether terrorist groups or fundamentalist regimes—aiming to banish all forms of freedom of conscience and thought.

<b>Del Valle: The timing of the event seems especially significant.</b>

Kassis: Since the Arab Spring in 2011, history has accelerated—both for better and for worse. On one hand, we have witnessed the rise of ISIS in Syria, Iraq, and Libya. Radical Islamists have gained ground and even won elections in Egypt, Tunisia, and Morocco.

On the other, a growing number of intellectuals and bloggers are beginning to publicly embrace secularism and reject religious fundamentalism. Some have gone so far as to declare theocratic, totalitarian Islam—now dominant—as unreformable due to the entrenched influence of those who manufacture religious fanaticism”.

Chief among these are the Muslim Brotherhood and Saudi Arabia, which controls the holy cities of Mecca and Medina, along with the majority of Islamic institutions worldwide.

Since the Arab Spring, a widening chasm has appeared between those who, under the banner of religion, seek to drag societies backwards by centuries, and those who advocate for open societies grounded in secularism, pluralism, and modernity.

<b>Del Valle: I recently published a book in France revisiting Karl Popper’s concept of the “open society,” which you’ve referenced. Would you agree that Islamic fundamentalism is not merely one form of religious extremism, but a theocratic, neo-imperialist form of totalitarianism?</b>

Kassis: Absolutely. I stand firmly against all forms of intolerance, fanaticism, and fundamentalism. Yet today, no religion is more afflicted, radicalised, or infected by totalitarianism and violent extremism than Islam.

The intellectuals joining us in Rome were all raised as Muslims—many still identify as such—but they reject the obscurantist and medieval trajectory that their societies have taken in recent decades.

They want to make it clear that the rise of Islamic extremism in Europe cannot simply be explained by “social exclusion” or “post-colonial guilt”. It is part of a broader global wave—a tsunami—sweeping across the Middle East, North Africa, and beyond. ISIS is the most brutal manifestation of this extremism, but it is far from alone.

<b>Del Valle: So ISIS is just one component of a much wider problem?</b>

Kassis: Precisely. ISIS is but the visible tip of a deeper, systemic, and transnational obscurantist wave. Its roots lie in the failure of Islamic reform and the victory of orthodox and Wahhabi elements over reformist voices.

Our invited speakers—Arab intellectuals who have paid a steep price for their dissent—recognise that the crimes committed by Salafi-Wahhabi ideologues, often with Saudi backing, have sparked a reckoning.

This awakening has prompted many Muslims to declare: enough to the violence committed in the name of religion. The Ad Hoc conference aims to denounce the existence of blasphemy laws in numerous Arab countries, which criminalise freedom of thought and conscience.

We also wish to alert Europeans—particularly multiculturalists—that by conceding  to Islamist demands—such as the criminalising so-called ‘Islamophobia’, they risk opening the door to a new form of totalitarianism. It begins when criticism of religion is outlawed—for the foundation of democracy and pluralism is the right to question and to separate the spiritual from the political.

<b>Del Valle: The instances of condemnation and persecution of Muslim intellectuals in the name of blasphemy are legion. Among the most striking cases is that of Nahed Hattar, the Jordanian writer, and satirical cartoonist, who was shot three times outside the Amman courthouse where he was due to appear—merely for posting a cartoon on Facebook deemed blasphemous.

In Egypt, Islam Behery, a popular television presenter, is currently serving a one-year sentence in Tora Prison under the Egyptian Penal Code. His crime: advocating for an Islam stripped of its violent elements.

Raif Badawi, a Saudi blogger, was sentenced in 2003 to ten years in prison and 1,000 lashes after founding the Saudi Liberals online forum—an attempt to promote free discussions. Then there is the case of the journalist Mohamed Sheikh Walad Amkheter.

Not to mention Asia Bibi in Pakistan—on whose behalf rivers of ink have been spilled and countless demonstrations of solidarity held worldwide. She was sentenced to death for allegedly ‘offending Islam’ by drinking from a Muslim well and refusing to convert.

Alber Saber, an Egyptian Christian, was arrested after being identified as an administrator of a Facebook group titled Egyptian Atheists. The page had shared a trailer for the controvesial film The Innocence of Muslims. According to Masrawy.com, his arrest was triggered by a tip from a Muslim acquitance.

Saeed Malekpour, an Iranian-Canadian web developper, was arrested during a visit to Iran because a programme he had created was used—without his knowledge—to upload images to adult websites. Accused of ‘desecrating Islam’, he was tortured and sentenced to death in 2010 by the Revolutionary Court. The verdict was upheld by the Iranian Supreme Court in 2011.

Even Erdoğan’s Turkey is treading a similarly obscurantist path. Many Turkish intellectuals—anti-Islamic, Kemalist, secular, and progressive—are not only threatened by radical Islamists, as has long been the case, but are now also condemned by Turkish courts and the neo-Ottoman Islamist government of Erdoğan’s AKP party.

It is clear that this phenomenon is no longer confined to the Arab world; all Islamic lands are increasingly falling under the sway of totalitarian Islamic obscurantism. If we do not act, matters will deteriorate further, and even the ‘enclaves of Islam’ in the West will be affected—rendering the integration of Muslim immigrants ever more challenging.</b>

Kassis: Indeed, we observe that the primary victims of fundamentalist Islamic intolerance are Muslims themselves—atheists, liberals, and freethinkers. All those who dare to think differently and in an ‘Islamically incorrect’ manner are accused of ‘blasphemy’ and face threats of imprisonment or death.

This is totalitarianism in its starkest form, and it will not cease unless intellectuals begin to denounce it—even at the risk of their lives. Fear is the linchpin of this theocratic-totalitarian system. Thus, the renowned intellectual and writer Nawal El Saadawi was murdered.
I would also recall the case of the Egyptian writer and poet Fatima Naoot, who was forced to flee Egypt after being sentenced to three years’ imprisonment for merely criticising Eid al-Adha—the traditional slaughter of sheep—on Facebook, describing it as ‘the greatest massacre committed by human beings’.

Those who escape assassination or incarceration must live in fear—such as the eminent intellectual Sayyid Al-Qemany, an advisor to our Ad Hoc organisation. We might also mention Kasem El-Ghazzali, who will be in Rome tomorrow. He is a secular writer and one of the few Moroccans to have publicly declared his atheism. El-Ghazzali is the author of the Bahmut blog, one of the most debated platforms in the Arab world, and has received numerous death threats due to his views. During the twenty-fifth session of the Human Rights Council, El-Ghazzali denounced the paradox whereby several intolerant Muslim states—including Saudi Arabia, which sentences ‘blasphemous apostates’ to death—are members of the United Nations Human Rights Commission.

We must also speak of the courageous Egyptian intellectual Sayyid Al-Qemany, another advisor to our Ad Hoc organisation, who faces death threats from Islamists. He demands the separation of religion and state. In 2009, he was awarded the Egyptian Ministry of Culture’s prize for social sciences, yet a campaign was launched to strip him of this honour on the grounds that he had ‘insulted Islam’ and was therefore a ‘heretic’.

<b>Del Valle: You appear to draw a connection between the intellectual terrorism of the ‘fight against blasphemy or Islamophobia’ and the violent terrorism of Al-Qaeda and ISIS.</b>

Kassis: Absolutely. Our organisation believes that terrorism can never be vanquished—and groups such as ISIS, Al-Qaeda, and others will never be defeated—so long as Muslim thinkers and Arab intellectuals remain under the threat of blasphemy laws.

The term ‘Islamophobia’, was originally coined by Iranian clerics and later adopted by the Organisatiom of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), sponsored by Saudi Arabia, which effectively serves as the United Nations of the Islamic world. The term has been strategically employed to suppress freedom of expression under the false pretext of combating religious discrimination, paving the way for a new form of  censorship and an Islamist inquisition.

If intellectuals are silenced—by threats, imprisonment, exile, or assassination—who will be left to challenge Islamic extremism? Even in the West, Islam has become the only religion that provokes such danger in criticism. Why? Because the more radical Islamists succeed in spreading fear—whether through psychological intimidation, legally warfare (so-called ‘jihad by court’ or outright terror—the less criticism there is. In turn, public discourse surrenders space to a creeping submission masked as tolerance.

If secular intellectuals like those participating in the Rome conference are not supported by democratic societies, then who will defend our values and delegitimise the radicals who threaten, persecute, exile, imprison, or kill in the name of sharia? In my view, the role of these intellectuals is paramount. If we do not support them, who will?

Our failure to do so would, through cowardice, deprive our society of the benefit of their contributions. In doing so, we eliminate any counterbalance to the propagandists of bloodshed, the purveyors of hatred, and the extremists who, as a result, continue to dominate the discourse in the Arab-Islamic world. The fight against terrorism is inextricably linked to the abolition of blasphemy laws
