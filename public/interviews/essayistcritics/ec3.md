The successive destruction of Palmyra by the Islamic State in 2015 and 2017 has often been interpreted as an attempt to purge Syria’s ancient history. Maamoun AbdelKarim, then Director-General of Antiquities and Museums in Syria, once remarked: 'The battle for Palmyra is cultural, not political'. However, this perspective overlooks the political dimension of what was—in truth, and perhaps above all—a systematic campaign of plundering. Franco-Syrian essayist and politician Randa Kassis makes this point emphatically.

<b>Western media have largely fixated on the symbolic aspect of Palmyra’s devastation. Yet during the recapture of occupied territories, it became evident that ISIS’s financial networks had been illicitly granting excavation rights at archaeological sites. In exchange, the organisation levied taxes on the artefacts sold. How do you assess this trafficking?</b>

There is no doubt that ISIS engaged in the organised looting of both Syrian and Iraqi heritage during its occupation of these territories. This illicit trade became the group’s second-largest source of funding, surpassed only by oil smuggling. According to the CIA, artefact sales in 2015 alone generated billions for the terrorist group.

However, we must not overlook the fact that ISIS was not the only party involved in this pillaging. Pro-regime factions, opposition militias, and local looters have likewise carried out illegal excavations, selling artefacts through intermediaries in neighbouring countries such as Turkey, Lebanon, and Jordan. These objects eventually find their way to private collectors or dealers in Europe. Today, the illicit antiquities trade is considered the largest in the world.

The first collateral consequence of this looting and destruction is the erasure of Syria’s historical memory—a memory indispensable to the country’s eventual reconstruction. Without it, reconciliation between the diverse ethnic and religious communities that have coexisted in this land since the dawn of Syrian civilisation will prove exceedingly difficult.

We must acknowledge the fundamental importance of preserving our heritage. It can offer Syrians a means of transcending their suffering and rebuilding a national identity rooted in the richness of their historical legacy. For this reason, the restoration of Syria’s cultural heritage must be made a priority the moment a genuine political process is underway.

<b>In 2017, the UN Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution to enhance protections for endangered cultural sites in conflict zones. The resolution noted that attacks on cultural or religious heritage “may constitute, in some circumstances and under international law, war crimes.” What is your view of this resolution and its limitations?</b>

The resolution is undoubtedly significant, yet it remains limited in both scope and impact. We are all aware that very few artefacts will ever be recovered unless states demonstrate a genuine commitment to combating this illegal trade. Such commitment must include the imposition of severe penalties on traffickers and buyers, and, above all, intensified efforts to expose the concealment of antiquities and to dismantle this market within Europe.

Heritage restoration should be fully integrated into the wider political process. It is for this reason that, in my capacity as President of the Astana Platform, I have been working with a range of stakeholders to develop a political and cultural strategy that can offer a way out of the current deadlock.

Regrettably, I no longer place much hope in the United Nations, which has repeatedly demonstrated its inability to produce even a single viable idea for addressing global crises. With each passing day, the UN increasingly resembles the 'machin'—the 'thing' derided by General de Gaulle—a lumbering apparatus recycling failed politicians and diplomats cast off by their own countries.

In my view, a truly effective political process and lasting reconciliation can only emerge through a cultural renaissance and the reconstruction of a shared historical memory.

<b>What role should culture play in Syria’s future reconstruction?</b>

It is premature to speak of a reconstruction plan for Syria. In the absence of a genuine political process, the country remains mired in partial chaos. Economic sanctions will persist and may well intensify. The return of refugees remains largely impractical. Bashar al-Assad’s regime will cling to power, yet it remains fundamentally fragile.

History is shaped by individuals. That is why I place my faith in the perseverance and determination of those working to build Syria’s future. As mentioned earlier, I am engaged in consultations with fellow dissidents and European institutions to develop a politico-cultural initiative that includes the restoration of heritage.

I remain astounded by the assertions of certain archaeologists who contend that destroyed heritage should be left untouched, on the grounds that destruction itself forms part of history. My response is simple: we, too, are part of that history—and we will rebuild all that the barbarians have destroyed. We shall revive Syria’s historical identity.

This fatalistic tendency among some archaeologists—who seem to revel in the morbid spectacle of ruins—reveals the depths of cowardice and complacency into which contemporary society has fallen.
