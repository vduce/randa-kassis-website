<h4>ISIS in Palmyra</h4>

“Now more than ever, the primary imperative must be to confront the Islamic State. The world recoils at the prospect of Palmyra’s destruction, but beside those millennia-old ruins — a cultural heritage of humanity — lie the mutilated bodies of 400 human beings, many of them women and children, slaughtered by al-Baghdadi’s militants. It is not enough to mourn the victims. The free world has a moral duty to act — not only by intensifying airstrikes against ISIS, but also by rearming the Kurdish militias, who are today the only force in Syria and Iraq capable of resisting and defeating the Islamic State.”

So declares Randa Kassis, a long-standing opponent of Bashar al-Assad’s regime, human rights advocate, anthropologist, writer, and founder-president of the Movement for a Pluralistic Society, in an exclusive interview with The Huffington Post.

Aged 46 and of Christian heritage, she has become a symbol of secular Syria, Kassis’s latest book, already published in France, bears a title that encapsulates the catastrophe engulfing her homeland: The Syrian Chaos.

<b>“The World Watches as Syria Dies”</b>

The world is reeling from the daily horrors emerging from war-ravaged Syria: the black flag of the Islamic State now flies over Palmyra; mass executions of civilians continue unabated. Meanwhile, elements of the non-jihadist opposition persist in demanding Assad’s removal as a precondition for negotiations. What is your position on this?

What matters most today is identifying the greatest threat facing Syria and its people. We must channel all efforts into one absolute priority. As far as I’m concerned — and I am not alone in thinking this — the most urgent task is to confront the Islamic State. What these criminals are doing in my country defies comprehension: it is not just ethnic cleansing, but also cultural genocide. It is the enslavement of women, the reduction of human beings to commodities.

<b>And Assad?</b>

I am certainly not one to downplay his culpability — I spoke out against him at a time when many preferred silence. But we must accept the reality: Assad has no intention of going into exile. Only by involving Russia can we hope to break the deadlock and glimpse even the faintest glimmer of hope. A viable compromise must be found, and all relevant actors must be brought to the negotiating table to help build a future for Syria. That remains a distant prospect. But today — and I will keep repeating this — the most pressing aim is to defeat the Islamic State.

<b>And how, precisely, should that be done? In your book, you propose solutions.</b>

The international coalition assembled by the United States must intensify its airstrikes against ISIS fighters and positions while significantly bolstering Kurdish forces. Our strategy must operate on two levels: in the short term, as I have said, it is essential to strengthen the Kurds’ military capacity by supplying them with heavy weaponry and coordinating their operations with coalition airstrikes.

In the longer term, comprehensive negotiations must begin between the opposition and the Assad regime. And for that to happen, Moscow’s mediation is crucial. I sincerely hope the West will support this strategy.

<b>But your strategy appears to run counter to that of a major regional actor — Turkey.</b>

My assessment of Erdogan’s Turkey is unequivocally critical. His government has consistently obstructed every initiative aimed at achieving peace in Syria. More than that — Turkey has, over the years, facilitated the transit of hundreds of jihadists into Syria.

Perhaps the most damning image encapsulating Turkey’s role, is that of tanks parked motionless at the border while, in nearby Kobane, Kurdish fighters stood alone against Islamic State militants.

For Erdogan, the priority has never been to halt the advance of ISIS or to defeat al-Baghdadi, regardless of the death and destruction it causes. His goal is the removal of his primary enemy — and former ally — Bashar al-Assad. If that requires enabling al-Qaeda or ISIS, so be it.

Such a reckless calculation is being made by a country that remains a member of NATO.

<b>Yet Turkey is not the only external player shaping Syria’s fate…</b>

Regrettably, no. I am also referring to the Gulf monarchies — in particular, Qatar and Kuwait, as well as certain Saudi princes — who have funded radical factions in Syria. These regimes have undermined the credibility of the armed Syrian opposition, rendering countless rebel groups wholly dependent on corrupt monarchies that also arm jihadists.

The consequence has been a transformation: many of these rebels have rejected the very idea of the nation-state, embracing Salafist ideology and aspiring to create a borderless “Islamic Ummah”.

This vision, steeped in Saudi Wahhabism, seeks to impose an ultra-traditionalist and obscurantist interpretation of Islam upon the world. Syria’s future must lie in the hands of Syrians — and this principle, let me be clear, also applies to Iran, a backer of Assad.

<b>You were once a leading figure in the Syrian National Coalition, but later left to establish the Movement for a Pluralistic Society. Why?</b>

It was a bitter realisation: the Coalition was becoming increasingly dominated by Islamist factions. Moreover, its leadership and policies were being dictated from abroad. Any movement that seeks to defend national sovereignty cannot accept outside control — no matter who exerts it.

I still believe in the importance of finding common ground among opposition groups. But I also believe — and continue to fight — for a new Syria: a country that is genuinely open, one that respects the rights of all its communities.

I say this both as a Syrian and as a Christian.

<b>Meanwhile, Syria is dying. The toll of over four years of war grows more devastating by the day.</b>

The situation is beyond tragic — it is the greatest humanitarian disaster since the Second World War. More than four million Syrians have been forced to flee their homes, escaping towns and villages reduced to rubble.

The international community should have assumed its responsibility long ago — for instance, by opening humanitarian corridors. But that never happened. And so my people continue to die or to flee.

<b>What does a pluralistic Syria mean to you, especially at the level of the state?</b>

I envision a complete separation of religion and state. What should bind us is our shared identity as Syrians — before being Muslim, Christian, Arab, or Kurdish. We must unite not through ethnic or religious affiliation but through common values: secularism and democracy.

We must oppose all forms of totalitarianism, regardless of the ideology they espouse — including Islamism. 

I’m well aware that building such a Syria will take time. The war has caused deep societal fractures, which may take generations to heal.

Today, anyone with a different vision is instantly branded a traitor or a foreign agent. That is why I believe cultural work is essential — to cultivate a spirit of solidarity, and acceptance of others.

We must come to see difference not as a threat, but as a source of national enrichment.

<b>Assad draws strength from his Alawite base, yet even within the opposition, many consider the Alawites complicit. But you advocate dialogue.</b>
Yes, for two reasons. One is tactical; the other concerns my broader vision for Syria. From a tactical standpoint, if we are to isolate and weaken the Assad “clan”, we must acknowledge that without a defection from within the Alawite community, the civil war will not end.

<b>Finally, on diplomacy. Unlike the Syrian National Coalition, you advocate involving Russia in mediation. But Moscow supports Assad.</b>

Yes — just as other countries have supported radical Islamist groups.

No one — certainly not I — underestimates Assad’s responsibility. But no one—aside from perhaps al-Baghdadi—seriously believes that Syria’s crisis can be resolved by force.

We must seek a compromise — one that leads to the release of political prisoners and real steps towards national reconciliation.

In this effort, Russia has a critical role to play — as do Europe, the United States, and regional actors. Let me add one last point: there is no family left in Syria untouched by grief.

But if we want to offer a future to this extraordinary people — if we wish to keep Syria united — then we must seek justice, not vengeance.

We must heed the lesson of Iraq: the removal of a dictator must not be conflated with the dismantling of the state. What happened in Iraq should serve as a warning — to raze everything to the ground is to pave the way for collapse, for militias and tribal fragmentation.
