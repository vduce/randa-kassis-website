Randa Kassis is a leading figure in the Syrian opposition and president of the Astana Platform. She began her career as an artist, but later felt compelled to change direction, studying theatre in Paris, where she discovered a passion for writing. Her work has explored religion, the rights of Arab women, the breaking of taboos in the Arab world, and the defence of freedom of speech and individual liberties. She is also a committed advocate for animal welfare and, in 2016, established a shelter for stray dogs and cats in the Peloponnese, Greece.

In this interview, Syrian politician and writer Randa Kassis—now regarded as one of the most prominent intellectual voices in the Arab world—discusses her journey and vision for reform in Arab societies.

<b>To begin with: from art to writing, and then to politics… in which of these chapters did you most recognise yourself?</b>

I see myself in all of them. But I would say that politics has enabled me to bring together all the tools I’ve acquired and apply them in service of the cause I believe in. Politics became the natural continuation of my evolving convictions—both those already formed and those still emerging.

I believe political engagement fosters a more expansive and adaptive understanding of life. My rebellion against societal constraints has always driven me to question social behaviour and seek change—through encouraging awareness of alternative cultural frameworks that may lead us to a freer, more conscious mode of existence. This idea has inspired me to explore different tools and experiences at every stage of my life, allowing me to refine my emotions and, consequently, reshape my consciousness and worldview. Politics, in this context, is the tangible means through which one can translate vision into action on the ground.

<b>Have you not become weary of political work—especially after some long and difficult years?</b>

I still find purpose in politics, despite the considerable challenges—particularly in Syria, where the situation remains precarious and the path to change is far from easy. I’ve always believed that perseverance is the key to success. Politics is a marathon: those who participate must plan strategically, remain patient, and adapt to shifting external conditions in order to achieve their aims.

Painting, by contrast, belongs to an earlier state of mind—one suspended between imagination and reality. It is the domain of the dreamer, of the artist in pursuit of experiences to merge with creative expression. I no longer inhabit that psychological space, and although I sometimes miss it, I don’t feel any longing to return to it.

<b>How did you cope with the challenges encountered along your path—from art, to writing, to politics?</b>

Challenges are inevitable, but they are precisely what compel me to continue and to pursue my goals. Artistic, intellectual, and political challenges differ in nature, yet all require the same inner resources: time, resilience, and cultivated awareness.

<b>In your view, what form should a political solution in Syria take today?</b>

It is now broadly accepted that only a political solution can offer a way forward. However, some parties continue to believe they have emerged victorious. I would argue that military success is no triumph over reality. Change in Syria is inevitable, especially as the economy remains crippled under sanctions.

The only viable path is through a political process that initiates gradual, meaningful transformation. That said, the solution does not lie solely in Syrian hands. It also rests with powerful states involved in the geopolitical theatre. As members of the opposition, we bear the responsibility of generating new frameworks and initiatives.

This is what we achieved in Astana—through the establishment of the Astana Platform and our contribution to the Syrian Constitutional Committee. 
Today, we are working on a new initiative, awaiting the right moment to launch it. I truly believe we will create the necessary conditions to initiate change in Syria, however long it may take. As I said, politics is a long-distance race that demands calm, strategic foresight, and an awareness of the broader landscape.

<b>After the Russian-Turkish agreement on north-east Syria and the deal between the Kurds and the Syrian regime, you stated that the arrangement would prove unproductive and that the status quo would persist—and you were proven correct. The question remains: how long will the current state of conflict in northern Syria endure?</b>

The continuing conflict and military tension in the north and north-east reflect Syria’s complex internal dynamics, as well as the longstanding rivalry between Russia and Turkey. These two nations are not natural allies; their alliance is one of short-term necessity rather than historical alignment.

I believe the conflict will persist as long as certain actors refuse to acknowledge the need for a genuine, transformative political solution—not a superficial one devised to sidestep the present economic crisis. War is not Syria’s only challenge. Beyond the horrors of armed conflict, the repercussions are no less severe than the economic collapse afflicting individuals, communities, and the country’s future.

<b>How do you believe a secular democratic regime—the foundation of your political programme—could provide a solution to the Syrian crisis?</b>
A secular state treats all citizens equally, regardless of religion or belief—and this is precisely what Syria needs, being a mosaic of diverse doctrines and identities. We cannot build an open, inclusive society capable of empowering individuals and communities without ensuring the freedom to choose, free from imposed taboos.

Of course, I don’t imagine a perfectly neutral state. The future Syrian state must acknowledge and respect the country’s varied communities, enabling them to express themselves freely—within the framework of a united Syria.

<b>What about the issue of Kurdish rights—so central to Syria’s social fabric—and the violations they have endured?</b>

A modern Syria cannot be built without justice and equality for all—especially the Kurds. I have long advocated for a federal system in Syria, as it is the only way for the country’s various communities to learn to coexist without falling into conflict over majority and minority rights.

Historically, Syria has been home to a multitude of peoples. I believe the only path to forging a shared national identity—one in which all Syrians feel represented—is through a neutral, decentralised state that respects Syria’s rich history and ethnic diversity.
