<h4>Randa Kassis: Unconditional Freedom Encourages the Principle of Questioning: Criticism Drives Human Creativity</h4>

Al-Awan  
20 December 2011  

Randa Kassis, the Paris-based writer and researcher, constantly seeks freedom across all times and places. She laid aside her pens and paintbrushes and donned the mantle of secularism, breaking through the ice of ego in favour of collective purpose. She began weaving a tapestry of life centred on the human being—dreaming as a sacred individual—and the homeland as an existential space, an icon that illuminates peoples’ hopes for liberation and freedom. Through feminine and cultural carnivals, she seeks to help build democratic and just societies, purged of the cultures of tyranny and oppression.

She thus found herself alongside her compatriots in Syria engaged in noble efforts to end despotism, dynastic rule, and single-party control. She seeks to strip away the masks of Arabism, resistance, and defiance that the Syrian regime uses to conceal its hostility towards humanity, freedom, and the region’s diverse cultures—masks it dons as it barters everything to preserve its throne and maintain its domination over Syrians, all while sowing chaos in the Middle East.

Kassis holds ideas and principles that go beyond merely ending authoritarianism and dismantling its legacy. She envisions a vital project for Syria beyond Baathism and chauvinism, laying the foundation for a civil, democratic world in which secularism unites people of all colours, ideologies, and cultural spheres within a Syrian house built on law, institutions, and pluralism—a shared homeland for all.

**You transitioned from writing, philosophy, and visual art into a revolution for freedom and the dismantling of tyranny in your country. What sparked this personal revolution?**

I believe my personal revolution began long ago. It manifests in the constant questioning of all we were taught and conditioned to believe throughout our lives, paired with ongoing doubt about every concept and formulation in pursuit of new knowledge through various stages. Visual art paved the way for me to delve into the world of writing, which in turn pushed me to explore research, all in the service of shedding the cultural and historical baggage humanity carries. In ordinary circumstances, life is a journey of discovery—but today’s extraordinary conditions impose a need for decisive action. The intellectual must emerge from contemplative solitude with a heightened sense of awareness, seeking contact with the outer world. Their tools of expression now turn inward, transforming the individual into a conduit for the collective experience, dedicating their knowledge and experience to serve human causes.

**Despite similar repressive structures, each revolution has its own context. Syria’s case presents a unique relationship between victim and oppressor. What is the philosophical core of this dynamic?**

For decades, the Syrian people were denied the full experience of life in its deepest meaning—freedom—which would allow them to realise their potential and talents. The regime deliberately reduced the individual to a being whose only concerns were survival and the fulfilment of basic needs, creating a chronic state of dissatisfaction. This dissatisfaction facilitated submission and control. However, it also bred an unconscious rejection of reality, with people instinctively searching for ways to discharge their accumulated frustrations. When an external opportunity arose, they seized it, transforming their submission into defiance and determination to confront tyranny.

**Freedom begins with the individual and aspires to build a boundless human existence governed by natural and ethical laws. How can we instil this cultural awareness in citizens who are often unaware of their rights, yet contribute to the creation of human ‘gods’ who become instruments of tyranny and symbols of evil?**

There’s no doubt that societies bound by a single version of the truth suffer from primitive legacies, lacking the tools for diversity in thought and behaviour. I believe the first step is to spread educational models and philosophies that embrace cultural and intellectual diversity, without directing individuals towards any fixed path. Perhaps we must begin by promoting the concept of 'non-truth'—a recognition that truths vary and evolve based on the human consciousness shaping them. This idea aligns more closely with natural diversity than the search for a single, immutable truth. 'Non-truth' invites the individual to integrate conflicting selves, rebuild confidence, and engage in unending exploration—of both the self and others—without falling into the trap of a narrow ego that reflects a limited, exclusionary culture.

**In one of your articles, you wrote that people will remain subjugated as long as they cling to God. They comfort themselves by clinging to the belief that they are heaven’s chosen people. Do you think this mentality will persist even after the so-called Arab Spring, amidst the conflict between the gods of political Islam and advocates of secularism?**

If we look at all primitive societies, we see them repeating the same cultural patterns. They fuel pride in their religions, which essentially expresses a state of defeat in the face of the other. This pride leads to isolation and the inability to adapt to external changes. I see these revolutions not only as manifestations of strong will to break political repression, but also as unconscious desires to shatter all kinds of constraints—social, mental, and otherwise. We are at a historic turning point. This moment allows us to implement changes that could expand individual awareness. It is, in my view, the right time to begin a cultural, political, and philosophical project that restores respect for the individual and his long-violated mind.

**You are now considered one of the leading secular thinkers working for change against both religious authoritarianism and political dictatorship. How can secularism become a cultural force to transition Syria from decades of oppression to a democratic future?**

We need diverse cadres, ideas, and perspectives to converge in creating a new, pluralistic culture that resonates with people and moves them towards a better future. To me, secularism is not a rigid doctrine, but a flexible, evolving framework that separates reason—rooted in empirical experience—from spiritual sentiments born of psychological interaction. The moral and legal foundations uniting people should be based on mutual interest and the balance between the individual and the collective. It’s worth remembering that unconditional freedom fosters critical thinking and scepticism—essential for human creativity and intellectual work.

Minorities in Syria live in fear about their future after the fall of the Baathist police state, especially given that some who wear the mask of democracy practise exclusion based on ethnicity, sect, or identity.

Indeed, exclusion and chauvinism often hide behind discriminatory rhetoric, inherited from primitive fears of the unfamiliar. These fears breed hatred and violence towards the other. Discrimination is a defensive reaction to deeply rooted anxiety about cultural difference—where ‘culture’ is understood as a behavioural and ethical framework. Therefore, meaningful change in how we relate to difference, both individually and collectively, cannot take place until we reach ‘zero point’. That is why bringing down Syria’s totalitarian regime is essential: it paves the way to combating all forms of oppression and discrimination.

**The Kurdish issue will be central to Syria’s future. Justice for Syrian Kurds is key to building a democratic, pluralistic culture. Can we envisage a civil Syrian state that truly embraces its Kurdish citizens?**

We cannot build a modern, humane Syria without addressing and redressing the injustice inflicted upon the Kurdish people. Though the entire Syrian population has suffered displacement and death, the Kurdish people were denied even the most basic rights. All components of Syrian society must begin with recognition: restoring the full rights of the Kurdish people, including the fundamental right to self-determination, is essential to closing this dark chapter. Citizenship begins with acknowledging Kurdish history and language, and granting Kurds the freedom to choose. Only then can we build a just state where all citizens—regardless of ethnicity, faith, or ideology—are treated equally. For such diversity to thrive, we must sever Syria from any Arab-nationalist identity and instead make it a homeland for all.

**How can the Syrian National Council truly represent the revolution and mirror Syrians’ aspirations, when it lacks a clear agenda to dismantle tyranny, has no roadmap for secularism or civil society, and is dominated by Islamists while liberal and secular voices remain weak?**

I speak here personally, not as a representative of the Syrian Secular Democratic Coalition. We know the coalition became part of the council, which is largely composed of Islamists who still approach others with a majority-minority mindset. Although they represent no more than 20% of Syrian society, their long-standing organisation, experience, and financial resources have given them a well-defined strategy. Everyone can change, and we must avoid prejudging—but so far, their actions still reflect an entrenched authoritarian logic. Their exclusionary practices are plain to see. They do not engage with others as equals, but as patrons dispensing favours—thus trampling minority rights and individual freedoms.

Given such a mindset, all other forces must unite to demand a just constitution founded on international human rights. At this stage, we must focus on unifying all strands of the opposition to bring down the Syrian regime.

**What will the Middle East look like after the fall of Assad, who has long fuelled fires in Lebanon, Palestine, and Iraq, only to reinvent himself as the region’s firefighter?**

I don’t believe the Middle East will be worse off than it is now. But clearly, we face a difficult transitional period requiring immense effort and resolve to reach our ultimate goal: justice and equality. Only then can we build societies free of taboos and mental residue.

**Do you still hope that Arab societies can undergo intellectual and cultural revolutions that purge the past of tyranny and injustice, building a democratic and just future based on human rights and freedoms—or are we condemned to perpetual revolution?**

Hope is the key to life—it drives our will to overcome difficulties and gives us the iron determination to continue our existential struggle against all forms of tyranny. Our journey is far from over, but I remain hopeful, optimistic, and resolute in our struggle to dismantle the fortresses of a culture collapsing beneath the weight of its primitive legacy.
