A man engages in sex as he would in any other activity of life, while a woman—whether a virgin or not—offers herself each time as though it were the first.

—Firas Al-Sawah.

Randa Kassis’ Book – The Crypts of the Gods (2012)

She was the one who proposed a National Day for the Defloration of the Hymen (though it remains unclear whether her call received any formal response). The article was published on the Al-Hiwar Al-Mutamaddin website and drew 93 comments, both supportive and critical.

(See Randa’s article: [“Towards a National Hymen Defloration Day!”](http://www.ahewar.org/debat/show.art.asp?aid=228571))

She was also interviewed by the newspaper Al-Mutawassit Online, where she spoke about her book (15 June 2012).

The book provoked significant interest owing to the nature of the cultural challenge it presents. The British publisher described it as an unprecedented challenge to Arab culture, grounded in a synthesis of research in psychology and anthropology.

_Where does this challenge begin?_

_It begins with the conclusion that religious moral systems—intended to define what is forbidden or permissible in human sexual relations—are in fact reinterpretations of earlier myths and social experiences. These systems sought in order to control and regulate sexual instinct to serve the dominant social order, and by extension, the authority of command and prohibition._

_The publisher observed:_

_These systems elevated their moral codes to the realm of the sacred, not merely due to an inability to understand sex, but also because they failed to comprehend the mysteries of nature. All they could do was project sanctity upon that which they could not comprehend.._

I asked my colleague Randa Kassis to introduce her book on Al-Hiwar Al-Mutamaddin, and she kindly agreed. The request was made via a casual message, as we are friends on Facebook. She graciously offered to send me a copy as a gift, asking that I wait three days for it to arrive.

In this piece, we will not discuss the book’s contents in detail, but rather focus on what Randa shared in her interview with Al-Mutawassit. In future articles, we shall explore the book’s key themes.

The interview, as the newspaper described it, was a search for the foundations from which Randa Kassis launched her challenge.

**The fundamental question: How did sex evolve from a natural (biological and social) act into a religious issue? I believe this is a central question, especially considering the flawed critiques we often see of marriage (or “nikah,” its religious designation) in conventional, repetitive discourse. A further question arises: How did the gods become entwined with this vital function?**

Randa replied: Following extensive psychological and anthropological studies of myths and belief systems, it became evident that the primary force underpinning these beliefs was sexual desire and the reproductive organs, which provided fertile ground for the human imagination to symbolically express itself.

If we closely examine this imaginative impulse, we find it driven by revolutionary energy seeking to articulate repressed desires. These desires broke free from external and social taboos through gods, spirits, and demons created gradually by the human mind, evolving according to levels of awareness and cultural context.

Everything is subject to evolution—including sex, which has developed alongside human consciousness. Life is motion; nothing is static. It is neither rational nor reasonable to continue relying on centuries-old beliefs. We must cultivate a consciousness aligned with contemporary developments across all aspects of life.

**Second question: In my earlier article, Evolution and Morality: The Great Unravelling, I posed similar questions to those raised by Randa. Has the moral hegemony over sex benefited human social relations?Has it fostered stability?**

**Al-Mutawassit framed it differently**: **Could humanity have fared better without these moral codes? Who among us can answer with a definitive “yes” or “no” – and why?**

Randa responded: Human morality is undoubtedly influenced by the awareness of individuals within specific times and places. It continues to be shaped by the collective interests of groups.

As such, it is subject to cultural, social, and environmental factors, internalised under intense pressure. The result is a set of behavioural expectations based on a particular level of awareness.

While the regulation of sex may once have been necessary, the broadening of individual consciousness and self-restraint now make such regulation less relevant. Today, individuals can reconcile their instinctual fulfilment with collective social norms.

My research does not seek to overturn the equation but rather to reconcile instincts with socio-cultural realities that reflect the psychological constructs of individuals. For this reason, I believe we must adopt behaviours and moralities aligned with evolving levels of consciousness.

Sexuality remains a taboo, especially in our societies. Even on Al-Hiwar Al-Mutamaddin, women often avoid discussing such matters, retreating behind the concepts with which they were raised—though there are exceptions.

**Third question (paraphrased): Your book exposes the ignorance and fear that shroud our understanding of sex. Why did the sacred become necessary for regulating it? What prompted you to write on this subject?**

Randa answered: Perhaps it stems from a rebellious nature I’ve carried since childhood, coupled with an intense desire for knowledge—especially in psychology. This was largely due to my environment and my close relationship with my father, a university professor of psychology.

The rigid nature of the surrounding religious culture sparked a revolt within me against all that is deemed divinely true, yet reinforces the herd mentality, devoid of individual intellectual freedom.

Human memory, laden with experiences and examples, compels us to re-examine issues at greater depth than they might first appear. This is why I felt the need to delve into the topic—to explore its rich history of imagination and personal visions, contributing to deeper collective awareness.

_(The real question: If over 95% of women in our world live under this rigid culture, how many have rebelled against it? And why?)_

**Fourth question: There are two ways to interpret The Crypts of the Gods:**

1.  **As an academic and philosophical inquiry**
2.  **As a pillar of resistance against ignorance, backwardness, and injustice**

**Which is closer to the author’s intent?**

Randa answered: I see the book as a crystallisation of an internal uprising aimed at dismantling mental myths through the lens of science and reason.

It reflects a desire for change that transcends the individual, calling for a collective transformation. Drawing on the language of science, it seeks to illuminate dark corners and reorder them with thought free from emotion, bias, or inherited belief. In this way, it participates in a revolution against the social and cultural forces that repress individual freedom.

**Fifth question (paraphrased): Did the book treat sex as an issue uniquely related to women? Did it tackle equality, discrimination, or other familiar feminist themes?**

**Why did Randa choose a different path—despite the religious discourse that always treats sex as a matter concerning women?**

Randa responded: Sexual instinct is neither exclusive to any gender nor reducible to one form. It is fundamental across all species.

Fulfilment of sexual desire creates harmony with the natural world, diminishing the suffering induced by socially imposed control mechanisms. These mechanisms have transformed pleasure into an internal battle.

When pressure is alleviated, individuals can select freely and experience mutual enjoyment. When instincts, desires, and actions align, one can merge pleasure with reality, seeking harmony between the individual and the collective.

In doing so, each free, creative person becomes a modern-day Orpheus—a hero striving for personal and natural harmony.

_A Note on Orpheus: In Greek: Ορφεύς (Orpheus)_

_Orpheus is a legendary hero in Greek mythology, endowed by the gods with extraordinary musical gifts. He was the son of Calliope, the muse of epic poetry, and Oeagrus, the King of Thrace. Countless myths revolve around the sweetness of his voice and the beauty of his music, particularly on the lyre. His first lyre was a gift from the god Apollo. Such was the enchantment of his singing that birds, trees, stones, and animals would sway and dance to his melodies._

**A New Question: Was Randa, in her own way, suggesting that religions were created to regulate sexuality, and that they later lost their way?**

Randa responded: I would not claim that religions were established solely to regulate sexuality, but rather that their roots lie in it. This is what I endeavoured to convey in my book through the exploration of the divide between the sacred and the profane, and by shedding light on the taboo—one of the most significant moral foundations from which religions derived their ethical structures.

This connects closely with the psychological impact that contributed to the development of social systems steeped in magical or spiritual ideas. Repressed and suppressed desires evolved into narratives that mirrored the psychological experiences of the child. As a result, the individual retreats from external reality into the inner world, seeking the sources of libido.

The sexual relationship came to symbolise the unconscious foundation of spirituality—a concentrated essence of the soul. According to Geza Róheim’s interpretation of various myths, a clear correlation exists between semen and spirit. The act of ejaculation, representing a form of symbolic death for the phallus, is a motif widely evident in numerous myths. These myths formed the fertile ground for the beliefs of certain tribes and, through cultural osmosis, seeped unconsciously into individuals.

Psychoanalysis also confirms the link between the earliest taboos and prohibitions on sexual relations within the family. The two core commandments are: Do not kill your totem and Do not marry a woman of your tribe, which, from a psychoanalytic perspective, translate to: Do not kill your father and Do not marry your mother.

(See Randa’s article: [“The Sex and Death Syndrome”](http://www.ahewar.org/debat/show.art.asp?aid=213783))

**A Question from the End of the Book: Life and freedom are inseparable. It is time for humanity to free itself from the prison of virtue. Is virtue a prison? Can one live without some form of virtue?**

Randa responded: Psychological maturity is attained when an individual reconciles their conflicting emotions and develops the ability to regulate their behaviour. Consciousness relies on its capacity to direct the self and surroundings, to govern thought and action.

To simplify, one might liken this capacity to that of a video camera: it allows us to capture images, observations, ideas, emotions, and outcomes. If we can process all these fragments as a cohesive whole, then we can initiate and complete meaningful thoughts and behaviours.

To reach such awareness, the individual must let go of the need for idealisation, in order to avoid the traps laid by idealised language and abstract notions, which increase the gap between their conscious and unconscious selves. These ideals, shaped by societal influence, obscure their real needs and desires.

In this sense, I believe virtue can be a prison. Liberation from it empowers the individual to develop ethical standards aligned with personal fulfilment and collective harmony, reconciling the often-competing emotions within the psyche and embracing the principle of natural diversity.

**On Accusations of Blasphemy: Might some accuse Randa Kassis of blasphemy—or at least suggest that her book promotes irreligion? Especially those who read only the titles, without delving into the content or engaging their critical faculties, as is so often the case in our societies? What would you say to them? Was it your intention to offend their beliefs?**

Randa responded: I did not set out to offend or hurt anyone, but I firmly believe that the right to think freely and to express oneself is among the highest forms of sanctity. There must be no limits placed upon thought under any pretext.

There is no such thing as conditional freedom. True liberty cannot be granted partially or selectively. It is the fuel that drives life forward—pushing the individual to explore new forms and pursue both personal and universal aspirations. This cannot be realised without traversing the stages of awareness that correspond with one’s level of knowledge.

**Final Question: What is the link between sex and freedom? Is one truly necessary for the other? Is Randa not putting herself at risk by addressing such a sensitive subject?**

Randa responded: Sex is a biological need, and its regulation depends on personal convictions. Enjoyment of it is no different from satisfying any other biological necessity.

What I aimed to highlight in this book is how these instincts, once personal, have been transmuted into a web of beliefs and prohibitions rooted in sexual libido.

Sex has become an unconscious force shaping the way certain societies think, indoctrinating individuals with distorted behavioural norms.

A Note on Libido: In French: libido. In English: libido. From the Latin libido, meaning “to desire” or “to crave”. It refers primarily to sensual and sexual desire. Freud adopted the term to describe the sexual instinct as a vital energy encompassing emotional life as a whole.

My sincere thanks and appreciation to the author Randa Kassis for granting this opportunity.
