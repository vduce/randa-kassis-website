Since the Egyptian feminist movement began extending its hand to other Arab nations in the late 1930s and 1940s, the Egyptian Feminist Union played a pivotal role in institutionalising feminism across the Arab world. At the time, women’s issues reflected a broader concern shared by Arab countries in the twentieth century: the revival of Arab identity and the expulsion of colonial powers.

The Arab Women’s Congress held in Cairo in 1944 — under the patronage of Queen Farida and presided over by Huda Shaarawi — marked a watershed moment in asserting Arab women’s capacity to defend freedoms and champion societal causes. The event brought together prominent female figures from both the Levant and the Maghreb, and its significance provoked the ire of the British ambassador to Cairo, Sir Miles Lampson, who wrote to the Foreign Office: “The strength of women in the East is equal to that of women in France.” This spirit of resistance runs deep in the legacy of Arab women, and their struggle has endured across generations, shaped by shifting contexts, causes, and aspirations. Even today, in the twenty-first century, the voices of Arab women advocating for their rights continue to resonate throughout the region. Among them are the women whose lives and contributions are explored in this article:

<b>Wafaa Al Bouzidi</b>

One of Libya’s most prominent women’s rights activists, Wafaa Al Bouzidi was born on 12 August 1973 in Benghazi to a modest family. There, she received her early education before pursuing a degree in law at Garyounis University, where she obtained her LLB in 1996, followed by a Master’s degree in Criminal Law in 2003.

Between 1998 and 2008, Wafaa practised law across civil, commercial, family, and criminal matters. She also lectured in Commercial Law and Negotiable Instruments at the Higher Institute of Administrative and Financial Sciences in Benghazi for one academic year, before turning to literary writing.

She went on to publish several controversial novels, the most notable of which was Other Faces of Hunger, released in Libya. The book triggered accusations of blasphemy and drew widespread condemnation from the Ministry of Religious Endowments and religious authorities in Benghazi during Muammar Gaddafi’s rule. The ensuing backlash compelled her to flee the country and seek political asylum in the Netherlands in 2008. She has lived there ever since and is now married. In the Netherlands, she has also served as a volunteer counsellor for Arabic-speaking refugee women.

Wafaa has remained a prolific writer since her first novel was published in 2006. Her works include The Cough Knights (2009), Na‘thel (2012), and Tulip Mania (2013). She has also written a fifth novel, The Novelist, which remains unpublished. In addition to her fiction, she contributes political and literary articles to various online platforms.

A particularly poignant piece — Women as a Bargaining Chip in Political Conflicts — explored Erdogan’s use of refugees as leverage against Europe. It stands as a powerful contemporary reflection on women’s freedom, presenting a vision of peaceful coexistence and minority dignity through the perspective of a cultivated Arab woman.

<b>Randa Kassis</b>

A Syrian politician, writer, and visual artist, Randa Kassis is widely regarded as one of the leading secular Arab thinkers of the contemporary era, committed to transforming Arab societies into democratic and just communities through the eradication of tyranny and injustice. Her political activism has long focused on exposing the Syrian regime’s hostility to human rights, its exploitation of national resources and values for its own survival, and its role in fomenting instability in the Middle East.

Born in Damascus in 1970, Randa began her professional journey as a visual artist, holding exhibitions across the Middle East and Europe. Through her artistic practice, she aimed to craft a new humanist model by drawing on individual and collective experiences across cultures and exploring the broader meaning of freedom — not merely as a set of social behaviours, but as a continuous search for knowledge and consciousness.

Randa’s art and writings reflect her belief in the universality of all living beings. She identifies with any place in the world where ideas may be freely expressed without censorship or taboo. For her, homeland is defined not by borders, but by the freedom to think and speak.

She authored the provocative book The Subterranean Gods, which interrogated religion and liberty. Her political engagement later led to several further publications, including The Syrian Chaos, From the Arab Revolutions to Global Jihad, and Syria and the Return of Russia. In her articles, she consistently argues that genuine progress in the Arab world will only be achieved through the empowerment of women. Her ambition is to hold a position of influence where she can initiate real change and contribute to building a society in which individuals are both free and accountable.

Though her involvement in politics has distanced her from the artistic world — as she has openly acknowledged — her entry into politics, writing, and secular feminist thought began with her paintings. She believes that creativity is born of lived experience and long contemplation, and her transition from art to politics gives her a sense of fulfilment. Looking ahead rather than back, she remains focused on the ideas and initiatives she intends to realise.

<b>Mai Ghoussoub</b>

Lebanese writer and publisher Mai Ghoussoub (1952–2007) stands as another pioneering figure in the feminist thought of the Arab world. She wrote extensively on Arab culture, global feminism, and Middle Eastern affairs in both Arab and international publications. Her legacy was further cemented by the founding of Dar Al Saqi in London in 1979, which became a leading Arab publishing house. Initially publishing in English, it released its first Arabic titles in 1983 and later expanded to Beirut in 1990. The publishing house soon became a haven for Arab intellectuals seeking to publish works on human rights, civil liberties, and critical interpretations of Arab history and philosophy.

A fierce advocate for women’s rights in Lebanon, Ghoussoub also addressed themes of democracy and cultural identity in the region. Her landmark publication, Imagined Masculinities (2002), co-authored with Turkish human rights scholar Emma Sinclair-Webb, became one of the most influential texts in Arab feminist literature.

Her best-known works include Male Identity and Culture in the Middle East, Leaving Beirut, Arab Women and the Masculinity of Authenticity, Imagined Masculinities, and Postmodernism: Arabs in a Video Frame. Her legacy endures through the Mai Ghoussoub Prize for Arabic Fiction. She passed away in London in 2007 and was laid to rest in Beirut.

<b>Fatema Mernissi</b>

From the Levant and Libya, we turn to Morocco, the home of the distinguished writer and sociologist Fatema Mernissi (1940–2015), whose work explored Islam, women, and the evolution of Islamic thought. Her books have been translated into numerous languages, and she emerged as a leading voice advocating for a civil society founded on equality and women’s rights.

Mernissi sought to illuminate the patriarchal darkness that had long obscured women’s roles in Arab societies. She challenged the widespread Arab narrative that feminism is a Western import, arguing instead that Arab heritage contains its own feminist traditions. In her book Scheherazade Goes West, she argued that the concept of the harem was equally instructive in analysing Western attitudes towards women as it was in interpreting Islamic heritage—suggesting that Western societies, in their own way, often exhibit deeper forms of misogyny than those found in the East.

A particularly poignant piece — Women as a Bargaining Chip in Political Conflicts — explored Erdogan’s use of refugees as leverage against Europe.

Mernissi sought to illuminate the patriarchal darkness that had long obscured women’s roles in Arab societies. She challenged the common Arab narrative that feminism is a Western import, arguing instead that Arab heritage contains its own feminist traditions. In her book Scheherazade Goes West, she argued that the concept of the harem is just as useful for understanding Western attitudes to women as it is for interpreting Islamic heritage — and that Western societies often exhibit greater contempt for women than those in the East.

Although her academic work was sometimes criticised for lacking rigour, such criticism was largely overshadowed by her widespread popularity and prominence in European cultural and intellectual circles.

Mernissi wrote extensively in French, English, and Arabic. Her major works include Beyond the Veil, Islam and Democracy, Women’s Dreams of the Harem, and Dreams of Trespass. In 2003, she was awarded the Prince of Asturias Award for Literature alongside Susan Sontag, and in 2004 she received the Erasmus Prize. She passed away in Rabat in November 2015.
