<h4>Under the Spotlight – Sex and the Arabs: The Great Confusion!</h4>

Arab thinkers – and even jurists – of earlier centuries were neither repressed by nor uncomfortable with the subject of sex and sexuality. Their approach was open and unembarrassment, especially in contrast with contemporary attitudes. Their stance was open and liberated in comparison to what we see today. So why and how did Arab societies shift from openly embracing pleasure to a life of secrecy and prohibition? What caused this regression? In this survey, several Arab researchers provide elements of an answer.

<b>Saeed Nachid (Moroccan researcher):</b>

Every position on women reflects a broader stance on the body, love, sex, pleasure, and even life itself. In the canonical Islamic text (the Qur’an and its surahs), nikah (marriage/sexual intercourse) was not belittled – quite the opposite. It was celebrated and sometimes even exalted (“Marry those who please you”), and remained one of the key aspects of heavenly bliss (the hur al-‘ayn, or heavenly maidens). Sex here was far from being associated with sin or guilt. Pleasure had a predominantly masculine tone, as was typical of ancient societies. But there remained a latent possibility for reconciling with the principle of pleasure. Instead of developing and incorporating this concept of pleasure into jurisprudence, jurists crushed such reconciliation, categorising pleasure pursued for its own sake as mere debauchery and moral corruption. In their view, pleasure was only acceptable if it served a “higher” purpose – namely, procreation. Thus, sexual pleasure became seen as a “necessary evil”.

Indeed, some jurists were creative in the literature of erotic love, though they were few, and such writings remained on the margins of their juridical output. Take for instance The Ring of the Dove, which is not part of juridical tradition despite its author, Ibn Hazm, being among the most renowned jurists of Andalusia. Rather, it belongs to literary production. In this way, what was repressed in jurisprudence often found an outlet in literature.

The fundamental contradiction in Islamic-Arabic heritage does not lie – as commonly believed – in the relationship between jurisprudence and philosophy, but rather between jurisprudence and literature. The stark tension is between legal edicts by Ibn Hanbal and Ibn Taymiyyah that criminalise love and desire—seen in the romantic poetry of Qays ibn al-Mulawwah, ‘Umar ibn Abi Rabi‘ah, Ibn Zaydun, the prideful verses of al-Mutanabbi, the ascetic odes of al-Ma‘arri, the quatrains of Khayyam, and the wine poems of Ibn al-Farid. The primary contradiction lies between a jurisprudence that marginalises women, reducing them to instruments of male pleasure and reproduction machines – even going as far as to describe them as fuel for the fire, the devil’s snares, or likening them to dogs that break prayer – and an Arabic literary tradition that portrays women not merely as objects of male desire, but as desiring subjects themselves, sometimes even the primary subject in contrast to the poet.

Jurisprudence permits a man to live with four women, whereas Arabic poetry recognises only love between two, with no third party. In practice, the jurisprudence – which negates the self, marginalises women, and suppresses the instincts of love and life – has prevailed.

<b>Ismail Mhenna (Algerian researcher):</b>

The History of Sexuality in the Islamic World is a crucial field that Arab and Muslim philosophers have yet to explore. Tracing the history of sexual practices in Islam would reveal much about the worldview that took shape during that time. It is clear that Islam, following its emergence, swiftly fragmented into sects and schools due to its rapid spread across conflicting cultures. Accordingly, sexual life as intertwined with the new religion was also shaped by these differences.

Sunni jurisprudence, for instance, developed in the austere, desert setting of the Arabian Peninsula and became ascetic and strict. In contrast, Shia jurisprudence and that associated with some Kharijite sects, which arose in the urban centres of Iraq, the Levant, and Persia, was comparatively more open – even erotically expressive. Erotic literature also flourished boldly and uninhibitedly in these cultural centres. Figures such as al-Tawhidi, al-Jahiz, and Ibn Miskawayh, among many others, contributed to this genre. It is therefore certain that sex was not a taboo in classical Arab culture. The emergence of taboos and psychological repression occurred during the post-15th century period of decline, and was further entrenched by the Sufi zawiyas and dervish lodges of the Ottoman era, before becoming obsessive and neurotic with the spread of Wahhabism in the 20th century.

<b>Abderrazak Boukebba (Algerian poet and novelist):</b>

My grandfather returned from France in the early 1980s, bringing with him, among other things, a large picture of Adam and Eve covered only by modest fig leaves. He hung it in the guest room. I don’t remember anyone objecting or even commenting on it, and I saw the same picture in several village homes.

In the 1990s, a group of armed Islamists stormed our house. The first thing they did was tear down the picture and trample it underfoot, declaring it forbidden. I entered Setif University in 1996 and saw for the first time the statue of Ain El Fouara – a beautiful nude figure, whose delicately sculpted form seemed to emerge from the stone itself. Erected over 90 years earlier, it had become something akin to a shrine. A year later, terrorists blew it up, again on the grounds that it was forbidden.

Last year I read Qutb al-Surur fi Awsaf al-Anbidhah wa al-Khumur (The Pinnacle of Joy in Describing Beverages and Wines) by the delicate jurist of Kairouan. In the preface, he explained that he approached the topic as a cultural theme. So where are we today in relation to that? Wahhabi ideology is among the gravest afflictions to have plagued Muslim civilisation. 

<b>Randa Kassis (Syrian anthropologist):</b>

All Abrahamic religions, to varying degrees, present original sin as rooted in a forbidden sexual act, which is clearly illustrated in many religions and myths. The result of this act was Adam and Eve’s awareness of their nakedness – that is, eating the apple that gave them knowledge of good and evil symbolised the experience of forbidden sexuality. “Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew that they were naked; so they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves coverings” (Genesis 3:7).

After the expulsion from the Garden of Eden, according to the religious myth, Adam and Eve bore their first son, Cain – the first human child – thus initiating the transmission of original sin through reproduction. It is from here that we can say Abrahamic religions were founded on the conflation of two acts: sex and sin (undoubtedly inherited from earlier totemic systems). We also know that memory plays a crucial role in passing down cultural heritage across generations. Therefore, the collective memory classified this act – sex – along with its associated sin, thereby granting it a dominant place in the psychological realm—one charged with fear and guilt each time the act is performed.

In Surah Ta-Ha, verse 117, we see how hardship is linked to the sexual act: “O Adam, indeed this is an enemy to you and your wife. So let him not remove you from Paradise so you would suffer. Indeed, it is [promised] for you not to be hungry therein or be unclothed. And indeed, you will not be thirsty therein or be hot.” Or, “Then get out of it, for indeed, you are expelled, and indeed upon you is My curse until the Day of Judgement.”

We also know that any cultural inheritance takes generations to be firmly rooted within any group. If we examine Christianity, we notice that in the time of the first Pope in the first century, women could preside over Eucharistic meals – a rite derived from the Jewish “Todah” or thanksgiving prayer—signalling the progressive decline of women’s roles within early Christianity. The prohibition of sex for clergy came later. In 306, a decree from the Council of Elvira in Spain forbade priests from engaging in sex on the eve of mass, with dismissal as punishment. In 325, marriage was banned for ordained priests. Then, in 590, Pope Gregory the Great issued a decree forbidding sexual intercourse and even outlawing sexual desire itself.

This shows that the prohibition of sexuality in Catholic Christianity was a gradual process – a useful example to explain how restrictions took root in other societies and religions. As psychoanalytic theory teaches us, replacing one feeling with its opposite is essential to suppress the initial emotion – and this, too, requires several generations.

<b>Saeed Hadef (Algerian researcher):</b>

The Arab thinkers and jurists of old were not troubled by sex or eroticism. Their writings on the subject – in poetry and prose – survive to this day. Some even authored entire works dedicated to the topic, with The Perfumed Garden being the most famous, alongside Nawadir al-Ayk, attributed to al-Suyuti. The regression did not only affect sexual culture, but extended to nearly all intimate spheres. Life itself shrank, and what leaving public discourse reduced to a barren space, dominated by tragedy, war, and fear.
