<h4>Palmyra: “A Loss to Our Shared Historical Memory”</h4>

<b>Summary:</b>

“What action is the coalition taking regarding Palmyra? Why has it not begun bombing Islamic State?” These were the questions posed by Randa Kassis, a prominent opponent of the Syrian regime, during her appearance on BFM TV on Thursday. “This outcome was entirely foreseeable, yet no one intervened to prevent these barbarians from seizing Palmyra,” she stated with regret.

“I questioned an American diplomat about Palmyra. Their justification is that Daesh (the Arabic term for Islamic State) is confronting the regime, which they also view as an adversary. As result, they choose to do nothing,” she explained. “I find this line of reasoning absurd. Action should have been taken. The fall of Palmyra is not merely a blow to Syrians—a loss of our shared historical memory, a loss for all humanity.”

On Thursday, Islamic State launched an offensive on the ancient Syrian city of Palmyra. The fighting has already resulted in hundreds of deaths, and the toll may is expected to rise, particularly with the threat of irreparable damage to its invaluable cultural heritage. The city is home to an archaeological site recognised as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
