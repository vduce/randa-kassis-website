Randa Kassis, writer and visual artist, remarked that many of her paintings reflect her inner world—often unconsciously. However, it is the works featuring female figures set against vast, open spaces that she feels represent her most authentically. In an interview, she explained:

“To some extent, I succeeded—I registered the style of ‘concealed nudity’ in my name. Yet over time, I gradually moved away from painting and turned instead to a different form of expression. I’ve since adopted the pen to articulate the thoughts that occupy my mind and explore the ideas that haunt me.”

<b>Beyond convention, how would you describe yourself?</b>

I strive to exist outside any boundaries that might confine or imprison me. My journey is a persistent search for both individual and collective experiences drawn from diverse cultures, all with the aim of shaping a new model of humanity. This constant exploration fuels my pursuit of life in its profound connection with freedom—not in the narrow sense tied to specific behaviours, but in its broader, more expansive form.

Through this lens, I seek tools of expression that allow me to delve into the depths, to explore life through a continuous quest for knowledge and an unrelenting effort to broaden consciousness.

<b>Between writing, literature, and visual art, where do you find yourself most drawn—and in which painting do you feel most represented?</b>

After pouring so much of my energy into painting, I began to gravitate towards academic writing—an outlet that reflects my concerns and serious attempts to understand the external world. I believe life unfolds in stages, and when we begin to sense repetition, it becomes necessary to change our tools of expression. Doing so reawakens our creativity and allows us to forge new styles that capture the mental representations embedded within us.

For the past several years, I have been increasingly drawn to writing rooted in the humanities. Painting has since become part of my past—one that helped me grow, to refine my thinking, and to select the ideas and concepts that would ultimately shape my path. Many of my works, I believe, unconsciously reflected who I am—but if I were to choose, it is the paintings of women merged with expansive spatial settings that represent me most.

<b>How did your artistic journey begin, and to which artistic school do you belong?</b>

It began with frequent visits to my brother’s studio. That exposure stirred something in me—soon, I found that painting had begun to invade my mind and daily life. My artistic approach gradually took shape alongside the act of painting itself. I was always determined to craft a unique style, and I succeeded to some extent—eventually registering the ‘concealed nudity’ style under in my name.

Yet over time, I began to step back from painting, seeking instead a new medium through which to express the thoughts and ideas that preoccupied me. Writing became that medium.

<b>In your view, is writing a natural talent, and is talent alone sufficient? Or are there essential skills that must be acquired?</b>

I believe all forms of creativity are rooted in accumulated experience and long, deliberate inquiry. Talents can be unearthed through a clear understanding of the self. From my perspective, the essential condition for genuine creativity lies in understanding the hidden aim behind our desires and choices. That awareness enables us to engage more deeply with the ideas we explore, allowing us to contribute something new.

This creative drive is fuelled by an inner thirst for discovery—a refusal to feel wholly satisfied. Instead, we subsist on small doses of partial contentment, coupled with a determination to advance, to continue searching, and to take responsibility for the paths we’ve chosen.

<b>It is worth noting that Randa Kassis spent many years as a visual artist before turning to other modes of expression. She went on to study theatre, which ultimately led her to the form that suited her best: writing. She is currently conducting extensive research for her upcoming book on human development. The first section, focusing on psychological and neurological theories, is complete. She is now working on the second section, which explores mythology in an effort to uncover the instinctual roots embedded in the human condition.</b>
