<h4>The Boundaries of Religious Symbols</h4>

France 24  
25 June 2009  
Presented by Adel Gastel  
Guests: Mahbouba Ben Nasser and Randa Kassis  

<b>Summary:</b>

This episode explores the French controversy surrounding the burqa and full-face veils, highlighting political, social, and cultural tensions. Central to the discussion is the voice of Randa Kassis, a secular figure who firmly opposes the burqa, arguing that it symbolises submission rather than religious devotion and poses a direct challenge to women’s rights and secular values. While distinctions are drawn between garments such as the burqa, niqab, and jilbab, the conversation underscores that veiling traditions often stem from cultural practices predating Islam and remain contested, even within Islamic scholarship.

The debate intensified in France following concerns about the treatment of Afghan women, prompting calls for the establishment of a parliamentary inquiry. Former President Sarkozy framed the issue as a matter of human dignity, not religion—an argument echoed by Kassis, who warned against legitimising patriarchal control under the guise of religious freedom. The programme addresses the impact of the burqa on social integration, particularly in secular societies where many wearers are French-born women influenced by familial or male pressure. Kassis argues that defending the burqa in the name of tolerance risks eroding gender equality and democratic inclusion, instead advocating a courageous, universalist defence of secularism and women’s emancipation.
