**To begin, a brief introduction to writer and artist Randa Kassis.**

Painting, writing, and all forms of expression serve as tools to convey thoughts drawn from deep within—shaped by the artist’s or writer’s vision of life. These merge with personal experience, conclusions, and a comprehensive outlook on life’s joys and sorrows, forming the foundation of one’s own path and perspective.

From the age of eight, I was drawn to psychology—my father’s profession—through the books that filled his library. I would often question him about everything I found difficult to understand. Over time, existential questions began to accumulate. I started to question my own being and the ideas I had absorbed from my cultural environment. This inner interrogation sparked a rebellion against many of the social norms I was raised with—and so began the adventure of my life.

I dabbled briefly in various fields, including psychology, and travelled across several countries in search of a place where I felt in tune. During that time, frequent visits to my brother’s art studio in France ignited an interest in painting, leaving a lasting impression on me. But years later, I felt a powerful urge to rediscover myself, which led me to study theatre and explore a new medium: writing.

**What does painting mean to you?**

As I mentioned, my artistic journey began in my brother’s studio. Gradually, painting came to occupy a central place in my life.

Any profession tends to shape the practitioner’s way of thinking, analysis, and interpretation. For me, the canvas became a refuge—a place I would retreat to when lost in mazes of tangled, unstructured thoughts. That’s where the tools of artistic expression step in, helping to untangle confusion. The unconscious mind becomes the true guide and translator of these ideas into reality—whether through a painting, writing, or physical expression.

**Tell us about your participation in art exhibitions. Do you notice a fundamental difference between audiences in France and those in the Arab world?**

Naturally, there are significant cultural differences. European culture has long nurtured a deep reverence for the visual arts, rooted in a historical interest in image-making. This contrasts with Islamic culture, where depiction of living beings has traditionally faced religious and social restrictions. We know taboos can stifle creativity—true creative transcends all taboos, however sensitive they may be in particular contexts. Thought itself is born, in part, from creativity—the ability to dismantle mental barriers that constrain the imagination.

I’ve held numerous solo exhibitions in both Arab and Western countries, although I’ve rarely taken part in group shows. While I value collective work, I lean strongly towards solitary creation. Perhaps it’s the complete sense of freedom I experience when working alone that draws me.

**Exile and its bitterness often feature prominently in the poetry and art of others, yet they seem absent from your work. Do you not feel nostalgic for Syria—or have you found in France a new homeland?**

I do not adhere to nationalistic, patriotic, or even collective ideologies. I haven’t replaced Syria with France—I simply follow a path of non-belonging, which gives me a greater sense of freedom.

I believe in humanistic and qualitative endeavours. My sense of belonging encompasses all forms of life—not just the human.

I don’t feel alien in a country that provides fulfilment and liberates the individual from social constraints that too often lead to partial enslavement. I view ethics as a conscious dialogue between the self and its desires, and those of others. It is through that dialogue that we come to understand the principle of rights—the right to do anything that does not harm others.

**In your article Towards a National Day for Hymen Deflowering, you wrote: 'I believe a woman must begin by ridding herself of the fear buried deep within and awaken her hidden strength, freeing herself from her enslavement by shedding her hymen…' Don’t you think this language provokes Arab societies, which may see it as a rebellion against nature—or a call for moral decay?**

I used the hymen as a symbol of the subjugation women endure in our societies. It represents an exclusionary mindset that men use to dominate women. At the same time, many women seek social validation and male approval by preserving it. A woman’s worth is too often framed around securing a man, and keeping the hymen intact until it can be 'offered' to him reflects a culture that glorifies male authority while reducing women to obedient instruments. The obsession with virginity and hymen is rooted in male ownership of the female body.

Many will, of course, interpret my words as a call for moral decline. But here we must pause and re-evaluate the language. What they label 'immorality', I see as a basic individual right.

**In a heated discussion on France 24, you stated that a veiled woman is as provocative to a man as one who walks about naked. How do you explain that?**

In societies unfamiliar with the niqab, it erases the features of the human being. As we know, human interaction relies largely on non-verbal cues—gestures, facial expressions, body language. The niqab suppresses all of this. It places the viewer—whether male or female—with an unknown being deprived of self-expression.

By erasing the individual’s features, the niqab reduces a woman from a living being into an object, cutting off the possibility of true interaction.

Likewise, in societies unaccustomed to nudity, the sight of a naked body becomes sexualised. A naked woman in such a context is seen as a sexual provocation, triggering desire.

**Though I strongly disagree with your view, let’s assume the niqab is indeed a major issue in France. Do you believe banning it by law is the solution—or should the focus be on promoting a culture of moderation—particularly among French-born Muslim women?**

It is difficult to promote moderation in the short term, especially given the rise of Salafism. There is a clear regression among devout Muslims in the West, fuelled by alienation and the absence of genuine equality.

For some, embracing Salafi Islam becomes a form of belonging—a subconscious rebellion, a way to assert identity in the face of exclusion. Moreover, extremist groups are founded on rejecting difference; they do not permit dialogue.

A legal ban on the niqab sends a swift, symbolic message: that French society rejects the values underpinning the garment. It is not a solution, but a statement.

The true solution lies in the French state embracing all those born on its soil and guaranteeing them equal rights. But such transformation takes time. It will require years to replace chauvinism with a genuine culture of equality across all backgrounds.

**Your view of Arab women seems rather bleak, wouldn’t you say?**

Arab women often play a passive role. Freedom and rights cannot be attained without sacrifice. women cannot place all the blame on men without also confronting the cultural values and restrictions that bind them.

Yes, I ask men to stop subjugating women—social privilege imposes responsibility. But women, too, must bear responsibility for their condition.

Only they can bring true change in their lives—by casting off the restrictions they were raised with and recognising that their bodies belong to no one but themselves. Perhaps they must first reconcile with themselves as women—and with other women.

**How do you interpret the current events in Syria? What do you make of the regime’s use of the “foreign conspiracy” narrative to justify its brutal crackdown on protesters?**

There is no doubt about the repressive nature of the Syrian regime and its deliberate use of violence to remain in power.

For decades, it has succeeded in opening a foreign front and invoking conspiracy theories for two key purposes: to crush any internal dissent, and to compensate for the people’s dissatisfaction.

Conspiracy theories exist in every ideology or religion that seeks to programme individuals for the benefit of those in power. These theories act as psychological sedatives, encouraging people to submit to an imposed reality.

In time, the 'conspiracy' becomes the only available 'medicine' for a society unable to innovate or accept difference.

**Which form of expression do you prefer when addressing the suffering of the Arab individual—writing, painting, or participation in a television programme?**

I believe television is the most effective medium for expressing the suffering of the Arab individual and voicing frustration in a reality marked by injustice and despair.

A camera can reflect reality with greater neutrality than a painting or article, both of which inevitably convey the creator’s perspective, even if they strive for objectivity. The moving camera captures something closer to an unfiltered image.

**We all need to dream of a better future—otherwise, we risk burning out in despair. What space does dreaming occupy in your work?**

Dreaming is vital to creativity. It is the spark behind every journey of imagination. Every creative act—whether artistic, intellectual, or scientific—depends on fertile imagination. Dreams are our primary fuel.

**And the presence of men in your life?**

Yes, there has been a male presence—starting with my father, then my brothers, and later, lovers.

Men have played a part in my life, though I cannot quantify or define it. For many years, I chose to live independently, avoiding attachments to keep my thoughts focused. But convictions evolve. What once seemed certain can change after a profound experience.

**What are your current projects for 2011?**

I had been working on a scientific book exploring the psychological and anthropological evolution of human beings. After completing half of it, I shifted to a new project focusing on Salafi Islam—its environmental roots and the early sources behind its formation and spread.

I hope to complete it within three months, as I’ve already made significant progress. I’m also preparing for several upcoming seminars.

**Thank you very much. Will you offer a painting to our readers as a final gesture?**

Thank you for allowing my voice to be heard. I offer this painting, whose symbols reflect ideas that continue to roam within my imagination.
