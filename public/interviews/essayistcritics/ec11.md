<h4>What is a 'moderate Islamist'?</h4>

Anthropologist and Franco-Syrian journalist Randa Kassis is president of the Movement for a Pluralistic Society—a secular political formation open to all those within Syria’s religious communities (Christian, Kurdish, Alawite, and Sunni) who reject sectarian divisions. In August 2012, Kassis was excluded from the Syrian National Coalition (SNC) following her denunciation of the growing influence of Islamists within the body, which aims to unite various opposition factions against the regime of Bashar al-Assad.

<b>How, in your view, should we assess the Arab revolutions more than two years after their outbreak?</b>

They mark the first real confrontation between our civil societies and the religious establishment. Shortly before President Ben Ali’s fall, I wrote that the death of Mohamed Bouazizi (Editor’s note: the young street vendor whose self-immolation on 17 December 2010 sparked the Arab Spring) and the uprising of the Tunisian people heralded a new era in Arab countries—one in which the role of religion would come under scrutiny.

During the Arab Spring, the internet became the battleground for a fierce war on social media between secularists and Islamists, moderates and extremists. It was a page-by-page cyberwar of global reach. For the first time, Arab civil societies directly challenged religious authority.

<b>Yet today, it is the religious parties and Sunni Islamist groups who are leading the war against President Assad’s regime in Syria?</b>

Yes—and that is no coincidence. The Islamist spectre plays directly into the regime’s hands. In fact, it was the regime that helped create it. Bashar al-Assad knew perfectly well that the moderate opposition lacked structure. So he wasted no time eliminating key secular opposition figures and then released religious extremists from prison. The regime has always known how to manipulate the Islamist card. In 2003, it even facilitated the departure of those wishing to fight in Iraq against the Americans.

Today, those same fighters—now returned—are fuelling Assad’s desired scenario: one intended to frighten the West.

<b>Do you believe Bashar al-Assad still thinks he can come out on top?</b>

Just recall the assassination of Rafik Hariri (the Lebanese Prime Minister killed in a bombing in Beirut on 14 February 2005). That was one of Assad’s greatest political blunders. Yet despite the mounting evidence against his regime in that affair, he was received a few years later by Nicolas Sarkozy with full honours in Paris, on 14 July, to attend the traditional Bastille Day military parade on the Champs-Élysées! How could he not be convinced, after that, that he can always manoeuvre his way out of any crisis?

<b>After having carefully avoided direct involvement, France and Britain now say they are ready to arm the rebels. How do you explain this U-turn?</b>

Until recently, there was a tacit understanding between Damascus and the international community: as long as the regime left Israel and Lebanon untouched, refrained from using chemical weapons, and kept its bombing of the population at a ‘moderate’ level, the major powers would avoid direct intervention. But for the past three months, the United States and Russia have begun negotiations—effectively excluding France and the United Kingdom from any political resolution.

<b>Paris and London promise weapons only to remain part of the game?</b>

Everyone seeks to remain a stakeholder, albeit at their own pace! The USA, Russia, Iran, Israel, France, Britain—everyone! The problem is that Paris and London are working with opposition representatives who are not the right ones.

The Muslim Brotherhood has taken control of the Syrian National Council (SNC), while extremist Islamists have infiltrated the Free Syrian Army (FSA). These radical groups are manipulating everyone—France included, with Qatar’s assistance.

The Brotherhood selects and promotes so-called independent Islamists who lack no real political influence but help reassure the West. It’s the same with the armed groups. Originally, the FSA was mainly composed of defectors from the Syrian army. But now jihadist factions have emerged, claiming to represent the FSA, though they have no connection to it. Yet these are the very groups noe being considered for Western military support—those who have just pledged allegiance to Al-Qaeda (the al-Nusra Front)?

<b>Some say certain groups are more moderate than others…</b>

What exactly is a ‘moderate Islamist’? Can someone explain that to me? In my view, such a thing does not exist. When one claims to be moderate, one stands for secularism.

<b>Can the negotiations between Moscow and Washington succeed?</b>

For the time being, they are progressing slowly. Each side is playing its hand. The Americans, for example, are pressuring the French to provide weapons to the opposition—though such responsibility should not fall solely on them, given their limited influence. At the same time, the US has targets on the ground, people it wants eliminated; it is conducting covert operations.

For Washington, the priority is ensuring the security of Israel and the overall stability of the region. Beyond that, America’s strategy remains unclear, particularly regarding Turkey and the Kurds.

As for Israel, it prefers a weakened, divided Syria. Tel Aviv fears the emergence of an Islamist government in Damascus.

Russia, meanwhile, has agreements and interests to safeguard in Syria. If it is given the right assurances, and perceives a viable alternative to Bashar al-Assad—a reliable leader and credible opposition—then a political solution becomes possible. Only Putin and Obama have the power to break the deadlock.

<b>It is said that the Syrian business class still supports Assad…</b>

That’s true—and in Damascus, the business class is the Sunni bourgeoisie. These Sunnis have economic interests closely tied to a regime controlled by the Assad clan and, by extension, the Alawites.

The business elite wants an end to the war’s stalemate, but they lack a coherent vision. And that’s at the heart of the problem: everyone claims to want compromise, but no one is able to lay even the basic foundations for one.
