<h4>An Interview with Visual Artist Randa Kassis</h4>

By Majid Elia  

**Would you kindly introduce yourself to the readers of Ishtar Gateway?**

I am someone deeply devoted to the paintbrush—an instrument through which I have breathed life into my thoughts and adopt a way of living that reflects the essence of art itself.

**How did your journey with visual art begin?**

I have pursued painting for many years, and the brush has always been my true passion. Through it, I found a way to breathe life into my ideas and develop a mode of living that resonated with my artistic sensibilities.

However, with time, I felt an urgent need to alter my path. This led me to study theatre in Paris, where I discovered an even deeper need—to write, and in doing so, to rediscover myself.

My love for painting was born in my brother’s art studio. It was there I first learned how to connect with the canvas. Gradually, the canvas began to infiltrate my mind, slowly possessing me, until eventually, my life’s rhythm and tone aligned completely with brush and painting.

**When and how did you introduce the pen to your beautiful brush?**

My desire for renewal compelled me to seek another medium—another vehicle through which I could journey further and soar higher. I sought to expand my awareness and refine my sensitivities, enabling me to perceive life from multiple angles.

I am in constant pursuit of transformation and the careful adoption of ideas that best suit the path I am forging—just as nature chooses the most fitting patterns for survival. Writing fuels this pursuit of knowledge; it supports continuous thought and enables me to draw connections across diverse readings and theories in the hope of producing original insights.

**Could you tell us about your latest work?**

I am currently working on a book that explores human development—psychologically and neurologically—while emphasising the biological foundations of our being. I am nearing completion of the first part.

The second part will focus on the study of myths from an anthropological perspective, with particular attention to their origins in sexual instinct. This book requires deep engagement with a range of scientific studies and theories, which I aim to cross-reference and synthesise. I believe that if we can deconstruct the distant past, we can begin to penetrate vast realms of knowledge and introduce new values and meanings.

**Did you encounter any difficulties at the beginning of your artistic journey?**

Difficulties are ever-present, but our awareness of them—especially at the outset—often stems from limited experience and a lack of clearly defined direction.

We are, after all, products of experiences and behaviours shaped by our circumstances. Yet willpower and conviction in what we do give warmth to our psychological journey and supply the momentum needed to carry on.

It is natural for critics and gatekeepers in any field to dismiss newcomers. We mustn’t forget that monopolies exist in all domains, where certain individuals form closed circles that can be difficult to penetrate.

**A personal question—when do Randa Kassis’s tears fall?**

My tears fall for no particular reason. Rather, they result from an accumulation of psychological pressure all at once. When they do come, it is not a single tear—but a flood. Still, it is a rare occurrence.

**And when does a smile appear on your face?**

My smile never truly leaves me, even in moments of sadness or anger. It may reflect joy and delight, but it can just as well express sorrow or a desire to release what lies within.

**Are you satisfied with everything you have created thus far?**

I feel a measure of satisfaction—more so for what I am yet to create. Before I look back, I look ahead, drawing up future plans for what I wish to accomplish—or more precisely, what I wish to contribute.

This is why I often appear both anxious and hopeful. I do not hesitate to recharge myself continually, creating mental images that guide and sustain me along a path I have chosen with full responsibility.

**Where does the notion of ‘homeland’ feature in your writing and art?**

I believe in the universality of human beings and all living creatures. I feel a sense of belonging to any place on this earth.
To me, homeland is wherever one may express ideas freely, without repression or taboo.

**What role does man play in your work?**

The presence of a man in my life is marginal. I cannot say where he fits—even grammatically speaking. My strong sense of control over the details of my life leads me to resist merging completely with any individual.

I do not wish to scatter my thoughts or allow my focus to be disrupted. What I seek is integration with all elements of nature—I do not wish to confine myself to a domain narrower than the one I pursue.

**What is your view of visual art today? Does the brush still paint in the right direction?**

I haven’t kept abreast of recent artistic movements for some time, so I am not in a position to judge or comment on them.

**What would you like to offer the readers of Ishtar Gateway through this interview?**

This interview has given me the opportunity to share a small part of the ideas that preoccupy me. What I can offer is perseverance—and my continued writing—towards completing a book I hope will serve as a reference within our Arab literary canon.

**A final word for the readers of Ishtar Gateway?**

I thank you for your care and attention to the voices scattered across the world. I also extend my gratitude to the conscious, inquisitive readers who remain open to exploring different modes of thought. Without readers, there would be no platforms or publications. Without you, the hope of nurturing new thought would surely fade.
