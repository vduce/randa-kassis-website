London – Syrian author and researcher Randa Kassis has published a bold and thought-provoking book entitled The Crypts of the Gods, which has attracted considerable attention for the cultural challenge it poses. According to the British publisher E-Books, “In this work, Randa Kassis presents an unprecedented challenge to Arab cultural norms, offering a valuable synthesis of research in psychology and anthropology. Her argument begins with the observation that religious moral systems—intended to define what is permissible or forbidden in human sexual relations—are, in fact, transformations of earlier myths and social practices. These systems aimed to control and regulate instinct in service of dominant social structures, and, by extension, of the authority embedded within them.”

The publisher continues: “These structures sanctified such moral codes not merely because they misunderstood sexuality, but because they failed to comprehend the mysteries of nature itself. All they could do was elevate what they did not grasp.”

In the following exchange, al-Mutawassit speaks with Kassis to uncover the intellectual foundations from which she approached this formidable inquiry.

<b>Your book sketches a kind of roadmap leading backwards, helping us recognise what we may have lost. But if we were to press you for a brief answer: how did sex—a natural (biological and then social) practice—become a religious concern? How did the gods become entwined with this vital function?</b>

After extensive psychological and anthropological research into myths and belief systems—conducted by numerous specialists—it has become evident that the central force behind these systems was sexuality and the reproductive organs, which provided fertile ground for the imagination to project unconscious impulses in symbolic form. If we examine the womb of this imaginative process closely, we find it driven by revolutionary energies—expressions of suppressed desires—seeking liberation from social and external taboos through gods, spirits, and demons, shaped by the unbound human imagination. These figures gradually evolved in form and meaning according to the prevailing level of consciousness and the cultural structures of each society.

<b>Has moral control over sexuality served human social relations? Has it brought stability? And if we were to invert the premise—might humanity have fared better without such moral codes?</b>

There is no doubt that morality is contingent upon the consciousness of individuals situated in specific times and places. It has always been formed—and continues to evolve—based on the shared interests of a given community. Thus, morality is shaped by a set of cultural and social pressures that individuals internalise through coercion, producing behavioural norms that reflect 
a particular level of awareness. In earlier phases of human development, regulating sexuality may have been necessary. Today, that need has lessened as individual have cultivated the capacity to reconcile instinctual fulfilment with collective reality. My intention is not to reverse the moral equation, but rather to promote reconciliation between instinct and culturally conditioned realities—realities which mirror the psychological frameworks of individuals. In this way, I advocate for moral structures that align with evolving levels of individual and collective consciousness.

<b>Your book uncovers the ignorance and fear that surrounds our perceptions of sex, and the reasons why the notion of the “sacred” was deemed necessary to regulate it. What prompted you to explore this subject? What was your motivation?</b>

Perhaps it stems from an innate sense of rebellion I have carried since childhood, intertwined with an intense desire for knowledge—particularly in psychology. This was shaped both by my environment and by my close relationship with my father, a university professor of psychology. I also believe that the rigid nature of Syrian society helped ignite the spark of rebellion within me, especially against so-called metaphysical truths and the “herd mentality” that stifles intellectual independence. The human mind retains countless memories, encounters, and archetypes—each shaping our psyche and encouraging deeper engagement with human concerns. This compelled me to delve into such matters and explore their history—rich with imagination, individual experience, and vision—all of which add to our depth and awareness.

<b>There are two ways of interpreting your book. One views it as a work of intellectual and scientific inquiry; the other sees it as part of a broader rebellion against ignorance, backwardness, and injustice. Which interpretation is closer to your own?</b>

I believe the book represents an internal revolt, distilled into a critique of intellectual superstition through the lenses of thought and science. It reflects both a personal desire for transformation and a broader aspiration to contribute to collective change. At the same time, it relies on rational and scientific tools to illuminate obscure aspects of thought and to reframe them within a structure free from emotional enmtaglements and inherited convictions—whether individual or collective. Its aim is to contribute to a shift in cultural paradigms, particularly those that suppress individual autonomy.

<b>Your book does not address sexuality as a women’s issue, nor does it deal with the themes of equality or discrimination typically found in mainstream feminist discourse. Why did you take this approach, especially given how religious jurisprudence tends to frame sex as a matter specifically concerning women?</b>

Sexual instinct belongs to any one gender, category, or identity. It is a universal drive shared across species. Its fulfilment fosters harmony with the natural environment and undermines with the natural environment and undermines the cultural mechanisms that transform unmet instinctual needs into systems of pain and repression. These systems regulate sexuality in a mechanical fashion that serves entrenched power structures of power. Pleasure is thus converted into a prolonged internal struggle. Conversely, alleviating the pressure on sexual desire allows individuals to make more conscious and discerning choices, resulting in mutual enjoyment and deeper connection. When desires, instincts, and actions are in harmony, individuals can align pleasure with reality and achieve resonance between the private and the collective. In this sense, the myth of Orpheus lives on in every free and creative individual seeking unity between self and nature.

<b>Are you, in your own way, suggesting that religions emerged to regulate sex—and that they subsequently lost their way?</b>

I wouldn’t say that religions were founded to regulate sexuality. Rather, I argue that their origins are deeply entwined with it. This is what I attempt to illustrate in the book through the split between the sacred and the profane, and by shedding light on taboo as one of the earliest moral foundations. From this, religions derived their ethical frameworks. The psychological residue of taboo helped shape social systems steeped in magical or spiritual thinking, where repressed desires were reimagined in narratives that echoed the child’s psychological world. This often led individuals to retreat from external reality and turn inward in search of libidinal sources. In this sense, sexuality is the unconscious root of spirituality—it is the distilled essence of the soul. According to Rohde’s interpretation of myth, there exists a symbolic link between semen and spirit: the act of ejaculation symbolically threatens the phallus with death, a theme echoed in many myths that provided fertile ground for tribal beliefs systems. These were later internalised often unconsciously—via cultural pathways. Psychoanalysis has also revealed that the earliest taboos were linked to incest prohibitions, giving rise to two primal commandments: “Do not kill your totem” and “Do not marry a woman of your clan”—or, in Freudian terms: “Do not kill your father” and “Do not marry your mother.”

<b>You conclude your book by stating that life and freedom are inseparable, and that it is time for humanity to break free from the prison of virtue. First—do you truly consider virtue a prison? And second—is it possible to live without some form of virtue?</b>

Psychological maturity is attained when an individual reconciles internal emotional contradictions and learns to regulate their behaviour. Consciousness is shaped by the individual’s capacity to direct both the self and the surrounding world. To simplify the concept, imagine a recording device that stores emotions, images, thoughts, and outcomes. If we can play back these internal “recordings”, we can shape our actions and beliefs with intent. Reaching this level of awareness requires dismantling the habit of “escalation”—the tendency to idolise idealised language that distances us from our unconscious. This internal disconnect affects how our behaviours and distorts our understanding of needs. As the chasm widens between suppressed desires and socially imposed values, we become imprisoned by virtue. Liberation from this prison enables us to construct ethical systems aligned with both personal and collective fulfilment—thus resolving the inner conflict between competing emotional drives and embracing the natural diversity of life.

<b>Those who judge your book by its title alone might accuse it of blasphemy—or at the very least, of promoting blasphemous ideas. What would you say to them? Was your intent to offend their beliefs?</b>

I did not set out to offend or hurt anyone. But I firmly believe that the freedom to think and express one’s ideas is among the most sacred of rights. Thought knows no limits—no justification can render it conditional. Freedom granted only in part is no freedom at all. True freedom is the engine of life; it is what propels individuals to imagine and pursue new paths, enriching both personal and collective existence. But this cannot occur without first crossing the thresholds of awareness and knowledge.

<b>What is the connection between sex and freedom? Is one truly essential to the other? And are you not placing yourself at risk by addressing such a sensitive topic?</b>

Sex is a biological need. Its regulation should be a matter of individual conviction, and its enjoyment as personal as the fulfilment of any other biological need. What I aimed to highlight in this book is how such instincts—once private and personnel—have been transformed into belief systems and prohibitions rooted in sexual libido. As a result, sex has become an unconscious force shaping thought in certain societies, giving rise to distorted behaviours and internalised taboos.
