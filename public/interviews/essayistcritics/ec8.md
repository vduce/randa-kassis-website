**Randa Kassis: “In Syria, the West is Blind”** _Valeurs Actuelles_ 23 March 2015 By Frédéric Pons

Interview with Randa Kassis. A courageous voice of Syria’s secular opposition, Kassis reflects on the state of her country, the real stakes of the conflict, and the West’s dangerously misguided posture.

A politician and staunch secularist, Randa Kassis was expelled from the Syrian National Council — the main political body of the opposition — for denouncing its Islamist infiltration. Alongside geopolitical analyst Alexandre del Valle, she co-authored Le Chaos Syrien, a work widely regarded as among the most incisive analysis of the Syrian crisis. Realistic and free from simplistic moral binaries, their analysis brings clarity to the true nature of the war and the West’s enduring misconceptions.

**How do you view the West’s attitude?**

Several Western nations are experiencing an identity crisis, which explains their ideological and psychological blindness. This has led to a naïve and dangerous understanding of international relations, and even to an uncritical perception of other religions, particularly Islam. The Muslim world has recognised this identity crisis and exploits it by reinforcing religious identity among Muslim minorities in the West — using them as instruments to criticise Western societies, which are habitually accused of intolerance and Islamophobia.

**Do you distinguish between moderate and radical Islamists?**

Islamism is inseparable from obscurantism. A so-called moderate Islamist is scarcely less dangerous than his radical counterpart. The former is often more adept at concealment, yet ultimately pursues the same objective — to establish an Islamic state and subjugate all who refuse to conform.

**Have Arab countries grasped the scale of the threat?**

While the majority of these populations are Muslim, they are not necessarily Islamist. The current confrontation between civil society and religious forces presents a critical opportunity to advance secularism and challenge literalist readings of ambiguous Qur’anic verses.

**Are all Muslim countries prepared for this shift?**

Turkey and the Gulf petro-monarchies — particularly Saudi Arabia, the Wahhabi patron of some of the most extreme jihadist brigades in the Syrian rebellion — are champions of political Islam and play a duplicitous game. These nations draw on a sense of imperial glory and seek to re-establish themselves as the epicentre of a unified Islamic world.

**Can a resolution to the crisis involve Assad?**

A pragmatic and realistic approach to ending the crisis must include the Russians’ sensible proposals and avoid excluding pivotal actors such as Iran and the Syrian regime — actors whom the Syrian opposition, along with its Gulf and Western backers, seek to eliminate through maximalist demands. A viable solution necessitates engagement with the regime’s allies and, to a degree, with the regime itself.

The first step is to negotiate with Assad’s regime under Russian auspices, followed by a gradual broadening of the negotiating platform. This does not imply that Assad will ultimately prevail or retain power.

**Is the Syrian National Council truly representative of the opposition?**

It includes genuine secular dissidents, but also puppets manipulated by the petro-monarchies and Turkey. From the very beginning of the armed uprising, Syria’s Sunni rebellion was heavily influenced by extremist factions.

**What is the Islamic State (IS) seeking in Syria and Iraq?**

Convinced they are Allah’s chosen, its members see themselves as heirs to the legacy of early Islamic conquests. They believe they are destined to relive this ‘glorious’ past. Syria, along with Iraq and Lebanon, is the principal battleground in the ongoing struggle between Shia Iran and its Sunni adversaries — a crucial step in the broader project of expanding a rigid, doctrinaire form of Islam. The ultimate prize is leadership of the Muslim world.

**Why invoke the early Islamic conquests?**

The Islamic State’s barbaric methods mirror those of that historical period. What is new, however, is their use of sophisticated propaganda to recruit individuals suffering from psychological or social turmoil.

The horrific acts perpetrated by Islamists are deliberate — designed first to drive away those who resist, and then to subjugate those who remain. The imposition of sharia is merely a tool to instil terror and enslave populations — a fate they regard as divinely ordained.
