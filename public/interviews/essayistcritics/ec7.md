<h4>Randa Kassis: “I do not believe in moderate Islam.”</h4>

La Baule  
24 March 2015  

Randa Kassis is a woman of exceptional courage. She is the founder of the Movement for a Pluralistic Society in Syria and once held a seat on the Syrian National Council (SNC), representing the Syrian Secular Coalition. However, she was later excluded from the Council for being the first to speak openly about the Islamist threat within the Syrian opposition. At the time, few were willing to listen. In retrospect, however, events have vindicated her warnings.

Although she remains an opponent of Bashar al-Assad, she no longer calls for his immediate departure—at least, not under present conditions. Instead, she advocates the formation of a national unity government to avert the fail of Damascus to Islamist factions.

Randa Kassis has just published, together with essayist and geopolitical consultant Alexandre del Valle, a book titled The Syrian Chaos: Arab Springs and Minorities Confronted with Islamism. The work is compelling, as the authors argue that the Syrian crisis has become the epicentre of a globalised confrontation—one that pits Sunni Muslims against Shiites, and Arab nationalism against a utopian vision of the caliphate with global ambitions.

Solutions do exist to combat this “green totalitarianism”, but this requires pragmatism and, above all, a nuanced understanding of the threat.

Randa Kassis was the guest of Yannick Urrien on Kernews 91.5 FM on Friday, 13 February. This exclusive and exceptional interview was conducted for Kernews and La Baule.

The Syrian Chaos: Arab Springs and Minorities Confronted with Islamism, by Randa Kassis and Alexandre del Valle, is published by Dhow Editions.

<b>There are still few people who truly understand the Arab world, and much of the West continues to cling to caricatures…</b>

Yes, that’s because certain so-called experts view the Arab world through their own particular lens. They present themselves as experts, yet have scarcely explored the complexities of the region… These peoples are not all Arabs, and their societies differ greatly from one another. Conversely, some Arabs speak of the West as though it were a single country, a single culture, a single history. So, one cannot truly speak of a singular “Western world” or “Arab world”.

<b>In your book, you revisit Syria’s history in order to help us understand why the country cannot simply be described as an Arab and Muslim state…</b>

There is a pluralistic identity deeply rooted in Syria’s history, and I aim to defend all the identities present within the country. To grasp the complexity of Syrian society, one must first recall that the so-called Muslim conquest was, in fact, experienced as an invasion for certain peoples—such as the Kurds, the Assyrians, and the Syriacs. Syria is not a country made up of a majority and some minorities; it is a land of ancient peoples who have lived there for thousands of years, only to be overtaken by Islamic conquest, with many local identities subsequently marginalised or erased. This is precisely why I advocate for a federal state—so that each people in Syria can preserve its distinct identity.

<b>You criticise Bashar al-Assad for failing to seize the opportunity offered by the Arab Spring to open up to the world and embrace pluralism. And yet, with his wife, he seems quite Westernised. Why did he miss this crucial moment in history?</b>

To be honest, I’m not entirely convinced he’s truly Westernised… Nor is his wife, for that matter. Granted, she was born in England, but she comes from a Syrian Sunni family. She began learning English at school, suggesting that Arabic was her first language. She was immersed in a very Syrian environment.
