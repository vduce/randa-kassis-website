“The burqa not only demeans women, but men as well”

A new association has recently been founded in France under the name “The Arab Association for the Defence of Freedom of Expression,” established by a group of Arab journalists in Paris. The association is dedicated to defending freedom of expression and democratic values in the Arab world.

Randa Kassis, a visual artist and writer who has lived in Paris for many years, is one of the founding members. She is currently preparing to publish an important book in both French and Arabic, in which she presents a range of psychological, neurological, and biological theories on human development. The book also explores the depths of mythology in an attempt to uncover its original sources.

<b>There has been a clear breaking of taboos—namely religion, sex, and politics—areas long considered off-limits in Arab literature and media. Today, we see a striking degree of freedom in writing about sex, especially among a number of Arab women writers who have broken with traditional norms in feminist literary expression. What is your view of this new phenomenon?</b>

After centuries of repressing sexual desires, it’s only natural that some would start to address these issues. However, upon closer inspection, we see that the point isn’t sex in and of itself. Sexual desire is a biological urge, much like hunger and thirst—yet we don’t treat food as the core focus of our creative pursuits.

Sex, like all other basic needs, is a natural part of every living being’s life. Enjoying it is a personal matter, not a question of intellectual freedom. It is a result, not a goal. Sadly, in societies that believe in fate and divine will, and which glorify the idea of perfection, the individual is denied reconciliation with their own needs and desires. In doing so, the core objective—achieving intellectual and personal freedom—is lost.

True freedom begins with a commitment to a liberated, unrestricted mindset—one that is open to deconstruction and reconstruction over time. It is a process of continuous renewal, stretching across years and centuries. This is the kind of transformative freedom that nourishes the mind, attainable only through ongoing introspection and inquiry.

<b>Do you think inherited social values and moral codes in today’s Arab world prevent societies from evolving—especially given the moral duplicity many young people face between tradition and modernity? Does this align with scientific and societal progress, or contradict it?</b>

Undoubtedly, any society that glorifies perfection, embraces arrogance, and crowns itself as the guardian of morality and truth is one that suppresses the individual—imprisoning them beneath its narrow cloak. Such a society leaves the individual confined within a single, fixed cultural framework, incapable of thinking beyond it.

This isolation causes society to implode inwardly, and people become programmed machines that work to eliminate diversity. This stands in opposition to nature itself, which is inherently diverse. To break free from this herd mentality, individuals must be encouraged to embrace their uniqueness and abandon the search for absolute truths—because truths differ depending on time and place. We must also remember that nature itself selects the truths that align with its own evolving patterns.

<b>You’ve spent many years living in Europe, specifically in France. How do you view the condition of Arab women today, especially as they’ve entered scientific and leadership fields? Do you see a contradiction between thought and practice among Arab men and women, particularly with the persistence of patriarchal attitudes?</b>

Absolutely. Although some women have reached high-ranking positions, we can hardly claim true equality between women and men. If we take a closer look at judicial systems, we’ll find that gender discrimination still exists.

We still see laws that protect male perpetrators—brothers or fathers who kill daughters or sisters in the name of “honour.” Such a law, unable to reform its language and definitions, is no law at all.

Governments that defend honour killings under the guise of tradition—preferring death to life—are patriarchal regimes rooted in gender discrimination. Before they boast about freedom and equality, they must begin by enforcing civil law and reforming the values underpinning their societies. Freedom cannot be conditional. A free person chooses their path without constraints, and can only grow through personal experience. It is only through these experiences that one learns to carve out their own course in life.

<b>In France, the issue of banning the burqa has sparked debate, especially among Arab men and women living in the West, who argue it’s a matter of personal freedom. What is your perspective on this issue?</b>

The burqa poses a different problem—it represents an extremist mindset built on coercion and the rejection of anyone who is different. It does not only degrade women, but men too. It drags humanity back to a primitive state, one in which individuals are deemed incapable of mastering their desires.

A civilised person is one who masters their biological urges and transforms sexual activity into a mutual, consensual choice—this is the path to the highest degrees of pleasure. We must not forget that the burqa is not merely garment; it conceals a repressive ideology that denies life and freedom.

<b>Can you tell us about your upcoming book?</b>

My book explores the neurological, psychological, and intellectual development of humans. It is divided into four parts. The first part focuses on biological, neurological, and psychological evolution, drawing upon numerous scientific theories. The other parts delve into mythology and its instinctual roots—particularly sexual instincts.

From there, I examine the origins of taboos from an anthropological perspective, focusing especially on ancient Australian tribes. This is a brief overview. I expect to complete the book by June, and it will be translated into French and later into English.
