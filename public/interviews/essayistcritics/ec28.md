<h4>The Burqa Imprisons Women</h4>

The debate over the burqa in France is far from over. Members of Parliament are seeking to pass legislation banning its use in public spaces. According to Randa Kassis, a Syrian researcher in mytho-sociology, the burqa undermines secularism and confines women to a status that effectively renders them perpetual minors for life. In this interview, she explains the reasons behind her opposition to the full-face veil.

**What is your view on the current debate about the burqa in France?**

It is true that there are other pressing concerns, such as social discrimination. However, this issue must be viewed from another angle. The burqa symbolises a prison—a form of isolation for women—while fundamentalist Islam poses a serious threat to secularism and freedom of thought. And since we are all stakeholders in the defence of intellectual freedom, we cannot afford to dismiss such an important debate as the one surrounding the burqa in France.

**Do you support a legal ban on the burqa, and if so, why?**

Yes. On the one hand, I see the burqa as a provocation, a constant reminder of the contempt it expresses—not only for women, but for humanity as a whole. It prevents individuals from evolving, from channelling their instincts and desires. It infantilises women, depriving them of autonomy and the ability to take charge of their own lives and destinies. On the other hand, this garment, in my view, represents a radical form of Islam that seeks to impose a singular, ethnocentric worldview. Out of a love for freedom—both intellectual and personal—I oppose the wearing of the full-face veil.

**Is there not a risk of stigmatising part of the population by banning this garment?**

Only a small number of women wear the burqa in France. Now is the time to act, before it becomes more widespread. Change sometimes necessitates the passage of difficult laws, but such measures are necessary to stem the advance of an ideology rooted in intolerance and rejection of others. Prohibition sends a strong and unequivocal message in response to the rise of fundamentalism.

**Do you consider the burqa a threat to public freedoms in France?**

A piece of clothing in itself is not a threat. But the ideology it often conceals is. It represents a form of tyrannical thinking. Let us not forget that some imams openly call their followers to wage jihad and commit acts of violence. This is a mindset that cannot tolerate diversity of opinion or belief. Such a vision of the world is incompatible with freedom, which by its very nature depends on plurality and the capacity for change.

**Are you not concerned that this issue may be exploited by the far-right or other extremist groups?**

That risk does exist, but it is one worth taking. It will not last long. The rise of reactionary forces can also give momentum to moderate movements. Transforming mindsets invariably involves obstacles and setbacks. It is up to us to devise the most appropriate and responsible strategies to confront a danger that is spreading rapidly—one that has the potential to devastate human civilisation as we know it.

**What would you say to young women who claim they wear the burqa of their own free will?**

Belief does not equate to identity. In many cases, it satisfies a psychological need. To those who say they willingly choose to wear the burqa, I would invite them to pause and reflect sincerely on the deeper reasons behind their decision. It is important to remember that the burqa is not a religious obligation in Islam. It is for Muslims themselves to strike a balance between modernity and their appearance, in order to ease the scrutiny Islam from the wider world.
