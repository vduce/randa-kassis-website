<h4>The Final Word</h4>

Palestine Broadcasting Corporation  
25 August 2011  
Presented by Ahmad Zakarna  
Guests: Syrian researcher Randa Kassis and Palestinian novelist Dr Ahmad Awad

In this compelling episode of The Final Word, Ahmad Zakarna facilitated a profound conversation between Randa Kassis and Dr Ahmad Awad—one that moved well beyond conventional frameworks of modernity and authenticity. The discussion unfolded as a bold inquiry into the evolution of culture, the shifting contours of identity, and the complex interplay between religion and individual consciousness.

Randa Kassis, speaking from a secular perspective, examined how religious structures can deeply shape, and at times constrain, the inner life of individuals. She argued that far from being merely a spiritual guide, religion often functions as a formative force embedding collective dogmas into personal thought, limiting the scope of introspection and self-determination.

Rather than rejecting cultural heritage, both Kassis and Awad called for its re-examination. The conversation championed the notion of reinterpretation—liberating cultural identity from fixed definitions and allowing it to evolve alongside human consciousness.

In a region where religion frequently intersects with politics and moral authority is seldom questioned, the discussion created space for irreligious reflection—not as a negation of meaning, but as a pathway of emancipation. It became an invitation to think freely, to question inherited truths, and to seek meaning on one’s own terms.

Ultimately, the exchange stood as a testament to the necessity of intellectual freedom and the courage to express perspectives that question the status quo.
