<h4>Did the Veils Bring It Upon Themselves?</h4>

France 24  
15 February 2010  
Presented by Taoufiq Mjaied  
Guests of the programme: Randa Kassis and Zeidan Khalif  

<b>Summary:</b>

In this episode of France 24, Taoufiq Mjaied moderated a compelling debate on the proposed French legislation to ban the niqab in public spaces—an issue which had sparked intense controversy following President Nicolas Sarkozy’s assertion that the burqa “has no place in the Republic.”

The discussion examined the extent to which the veil, particularly in its full-face form, had become a media spectacle and a symbol of deeper societal tensions between secular values and religious expression. Randa Kassis, speaking from a secular and feminist perspective, argued that the niqab is not merely a matter of personal faith but also a reflection of broader patriarchal structures. She argued that its growing visibility in public life had contributed to its politicisation, undermining the foundational principles of gender equality and civic unity in France.

In a particularly forceful exchange, Kassis described her opponent’s defence of the niqab—delivered by a Muslim Arab university professor based in Paris—as an “intellectual rape of women.” Her remark underscored her profound concern that someone entrusted with shaping minds—in the very capital of Enlightenment—could invoke personal liberty to justify a garment she saw as emblematic of systemic oppression.

In contrast, Zeidan Khalifeh defended the right of women to wear the niqab, framing the debate as a matter of personal liberty within a democratic society. He cautioned that banning the veil could alienate communities and undermine the very freedoms the Republic seeks to protect.
