<h4>Sakineh: A Humanitarian Case or Political Pressure?</h4>

France 24
11 September 2010
Presented by Taoufiq Mjaied
Guests: Haitham Manna, Randa Kassis and Slim Ben Hmidane

<b>Summary:</b>

This episode of France 24 delved into the harrowing case of Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani, the Iranian woman sentenced to death by stoning for adultery and alleged complicity in her husband’s murder. While global outrage and human rights advocacy led to the suspension of her execution, the case sparked a deeper debate on the role of religious law within modern legal systems, and the complex entanglement of faith, gender, justice, and politics.

The discussion brought together a range of voices. Randa Kassis, approaching the issue from a secular and anthropological perspective, challenged the legitimacy of punitive practices rooted in religious jurisprudence—particularly when they disproportionately target women. She argued that deeply internalised religious codes continue to shape state laws under the guise of moral righteousness, often reinforcing patriarchal control.

The debate explored the doctrinal basis of stoning, noting that its foundations lie more in historical jurisprudence than in the Qur’anic text itself. Differences between Sunni and Shia interpretations were discussed, alongside the broader tension between naql (tradition) and ‘aql (reason) within Islamic thought.

Haitham Manna cautioned against the instrumentalisation of humanitarian crises by Western powers for geopolitical ends, urging a more principled, consistent defence of rights. Slim Ben Hmidane stressed the need for internal reform anchored in dignity, legality, and the universality of human rights, rather than externally imposed solutions.

At its core, the episode interrogated whether societies governed by religious authority can truly uphold universal principles of justice—or whether a profound reckoning with tradition is necessary to safeguard individual freedoms. The call was clear: abolish corporal punishment, resist the politicisation of religion, and nurture reform from within—driven by critical thought, legal integrity, and a shared human conscience.
