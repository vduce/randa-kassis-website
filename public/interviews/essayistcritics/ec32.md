<h4>Culture Knows No Crisis</4h>

France 24  
16 March 2009  
Presented by Taoufiq Mjaied  
Guests: Hashem Saleh, Mahmoud Ismail, and Randa Kassis

<b>Summary:</b>

On the occasion of the Book Fair, the programme turned its attention to the theme of culture—its place and resilience in the context of the global crisis. As the French public continues to flock to theatres, cinemas, and book fairs, could this suggest that culture now serves as the most effective antidote to crisis? And how can culture endure in times of financial constraint and limited liquidity?

Although cultural engagement remains relatively robust in countries such as France—where books, films, and exhibitions are still accessible—the outlook is far less optimistic in regions plagued by political repression and economic instability. In such contexts, culture is often relegated to the status of a luxury: marginalised by survival imperatives and hindered by the absence of systemic support. The Arab world, in particular, suffers from deep-rooted structural barriers that inhibit the flourishing of a vibrant cultural sphere.

The participants offered their perspectives on the state of culture in the Arab world. Randa Kassis drew attention to the alarmingly low book sales across Arab societies and the pervasive censorship that continues to suppress intellectual freedom. She underscored how scientific, political, and philosophical works—especially those that challenge dominant religious doctrines—are frequently banned, leaving the Arab reader confined within a rigid and regressive mindset, one offering little beyond myth and superstition.

Kassis further noted that the total number of books translated into Arabic since the tenth century is reportedly equivalent to the number translated into Spanish in the space of a single year—a sobering reflection of the Arab world’s chronic underinvestment in knowledge production and intellectual openness.
