<h4>Hiwar Al-Arab: Women in Arab Societies</h4>

Al Arabiya Channel  
7 June 2012  
Presented by Muntaha Al Ramahi  
Guests: Badriya Al-Bishr, Randa Kassis, Dalaa Al-Mufti

<b>Summary:</b>

The episode brought together three prominent Arab women—Randa Kassis, Badriya Al-Bishr, and Dalaa Al-Mufti—for a candid discussion on the status of women in Arab societies. The conversation explored whether the challenges faced by women stem from religion, culture, politics, or internal dynamics among women themselves.

Randa Kassis delivered a forthright political critique, asserting that the oppression of Arab women is fundamentally rooted in political systems that exploit religion and patriarchal traditions to uphold male dominance. She emphasised that the problem lies not in religion or culture per se, but in how both are interpreted and enforced by those in power. Kassis highlighted the marginalisation of women following the Arab revolutions, despite their active involvement, and pointed to the harmful consequences of rivalry and lack of solidarity among women. She underscored the importance of economic independence and structural reform as prerequisites for achieving genuine equality.

Badriya Al-Bishr focused on the intersection of culture and legislation. While acknowledging some progress through legal reforms, she emphasised that societal attitudes, cultural taboos, and the blurring of lines between tradition and religious doctrine continue to hinder progress. She noted that legal rights are frequently undermined by prevailing social practices and argued that education and media play a crucial role in shaping public perceptions of women.

Dalaa Al-Mufti explored the psychological and internal aspects of the issue. She reflected on how shame and guilt are instilled in girls from an early age, weakening their self-worth and diminishing their capacity to challenge inequality. She questioned whether women are always oppressed, at times restrained by internalised beliefs and fear. Nevertheless, she acknowledged the need for both structural reform and stronger solidarity among women.

The discussion revealed overlapping concerns but differing focal points. All three participants agreed that meaningful change demands a confrontation with entrenched power structures, a re-evaluation of dominant interpretations, and a combination of legal reform and heightened cultural awareness.
