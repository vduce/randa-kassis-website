<h4>Muslim and Secular: Women Who Defy the Qur’an</h4>

Ayaan, Nonie, Shahinaz… Each of them confronts, on a daily basis, the archaic structures of societies where women’s rights are still far from fully recognised. In Musulmanes et laïques en révolte (“Muslim and Secular Women in Revolt”), two journalists profile women driven by a deep desire for change.

Hailing from Arab or African societies, these women are determined to challenge entrenched mindsets—whether labelled custom, tradition, or fundamentalism—which remain resistant to reform. Egyptians, Tunisians, Syrians: they have emerged as public figures—politicians, researchers, journalists—fighting for basic rights. In their book, Monique Ayoun and Malika Boussouf present the portraits of twenty exceptional women, all engaged in a relentless struggle for dignity, equality, and the right to define their own lives. These rebels are united by a shared desire for change, born from personal experience and fuelled by political developments that offered a glimmer of hope. Here are four of them—each convinced that freedom is within reach.

<b>Randa Kassis, Syrian painter, anthropologist, journalist, and opponent of Bashar al-Assad’s regime<b>

<b>“I’d rather defend ‘marriage for no one’”</b>

Born in Damascus, Randa has identified as an atheist since childhood. With an agnostic father and a Greek Orthodox mother, her family embodied the divisions plaguing her country: her father opposed Hafez al-Assad’s regime, while her mother supported it. At the age of five, she accidentally ruptured her hymen—an experience that would later take on political significance. “What I resented most was the idea of having to ‘give’ one’s virginity to a husband,” she says today. As marriage was so tightly bound to the hymen, she eventually rejected both. As a rebellious teenager, she joined her brother in France, a country she instantly fell in love with. A painter of nudes and a single mother, she explored kickboxing and theatre before entering politics in 2008.

One of the first Syrian women to speak out online, she voiced concern over the rise of radical Islamism. In 2011, after the outbreak of the “Syrian Spring,” she joined the Syrian National Council but was expelled following her outspoken criticism of Islamists. In September 2012, she founded a new political movement—the Movement for a Pluralistic Society—aiming to unite Syrians beyond ethnic and sectarian divides.

Her struggle

Randa’s priority is to see the fall of Bashar al-Assad’s regime. She seeks to negotiate a compromise with elements of the regime in order to end the bloodshed. A committed advocate for a pluralistic, secular society, she is convinced that women will lead the charge for change—because they have nothing left to lose. Her ambition is to reach the highest levels of power and help transform Syria into a democracy.

<b>Ayaan Hirsi Ali, Somali-born, former Dutch MP</b>

Born in Somalia, Ayaan spent her childhood between Saudi Arabia, Ethiopia, and Kenya. Her father, a political opponent of the Somali regime, ensured she was educated—but also forced her into marriage. Muslim, Black, beautiful, and circumcised, she never challenged authority—until the day she boarded a train to the Netherlands. At 22, she sought political asylum and enrolled in political science at Leiden University. “I simply thought about the life of my mother and the women around me when I was growing up. I was guided by a mix of curiosity and the conviction that there must be something better,” she recalls. “I left behind a world of faith, circumcision, and forced marriage for one of reason and emancipation.”

“Helping women regain control of their lives”

After acquiring Dutch citizenship, she entered politics, initially with the Labour Party and later with the Liberal VVD, under whose banner she became an MP. Following the 11 September attacks, she publicly declared herself an atheist, which led to serious death threats.

Her struggle

Ayaan fights against communitarianism in the Netherlands, particularly in so-called “sharia zones” governed by Islamist norms. By challenging the fragmentation of Muslim communities, she advocates for a secular framework that ensures tolerance for all religions. She also campaigns for women trapped within a repressive and regressive form of Islam: “There are thousands of them, imprisoned within the walls of irrationality and superstition. I need to be heard—to persuade them to reclaim control over their lives.”

<b>Nonie Darwish, Egyptian-born journalist and Christian convert</b>

Nonie grew up in Gaza under Egyptian control during the era of Nasser’s pan-Arabist ambitions and opposition to Israel. Her father, the head of Egyptian military intelligence, led men prepared to kill Jews in the name of jihad. “At school, we were taught hatred, revenge, and retribution,” she recalls. “Peace wasn’t seen as a virtue in Islam—it was viewed as a sign of defeat and weakness,” she adds.

“Arab culture is poisoned by terrorism and its rhetoric of hate”

In Cairo, she studied sociology, refused to wear the veil, and struggled with the restrictions placed on women in Arab societies. After becoming a journalist, she emigrated to the United States, where she married a Coptic Egyptian. Attending a mosque there shocked her: “It felt like they wanted to Islamise America,” she says. The 9/11 attacks proved to be a turning point in her thinking. Friends in Egypt spoke of a Jewish conspiracy. That was the final straw. After converting to Christianity, she published a widely circulated open letter and, in 2004, founded a forum dedicated to religious tolerance.

Her struggle

Nonie campaigns for Arabs and Muslims to support Israel and calls for constructive self-criticism within the Arab-Muslim world. She was one of the signatories of the Secular Islam Summit Declaration (5 April 2007), which advocated the separation of mosque and state in Muslim-majority countries. A staunch free-thinker, she believes the West must not shy away from confronting dangerous ideologies. “The West shouldn’t fear offending Muslims—after all, Muslims themselves are the primary victims of this ideology.”

<b>Shahinaz Abdel Salam, Alexandrian engineer and blogger</b>

From a devout, conservative family, Shahinaz is the only woman among her relatives to have taken an alternative path, rejecting the conventional “education-marriage-children” formula. While studying engineering, she divorced after one unhappy year of marriage and resolved to claim her freedom: she refused to wear the veil, moved into her own flat in Cairo, and secured a job as an engineer. In 2005, she began criticising Hosni Mubarak’s regime on her blog An Egyptian Woman. Her denunciation of censorship struck a chord with other cyber-activists who joined the call for revolt.

“My family, friends, and colleagues thought I was a suicidal lunatic,” she says. But she refused to give up, continuing her activism despite being placed under surveillance, receiving daily threats, and even spending several days in prison. Together with friends, she helped launch the 6 April Movement, which contributed to Mubarak’s resignation on 11 February 2011.

“It’s Egyptian women who will bring about real change”

Her struggle

Since Mubarak’s fall, Shahinaz has campaigned tirelessly to eliminate fear among young people. While attitudes have evolved, one social issue remains deeply entrenched in Egypt: sexual harassment. “Nothing deters the harassers—neither age, nor a wedding ring, nor the veil,” she says. “I still carry stones in my handbag.” She refraines from attacking religion itself, focusing instead on the toxic nexus of tradition and misogynistic religious interpretations. She has come to realise that even among her revolutionary peers, there was a disturbing lack of concern for the plight of Egyptian women. Today, Shahinaz is convinced that her fellow women are finally ready to raise their voices and fight for their rights.
