<h4>Randa Kassis Chooses the Thorny Path of Painting and Writing</h4>

Randa Kassis has chosen the arduous and thorny path of writing rooted in scientific research and profound philosophical thought. She embodies the modern woman—open to languages and global cultures, and resistant to any law that seeks to confine her. She is constantly seeking to explore life, which she views as intrinsically linked to freedom—not in its narrow, superficial sense confined to certain behaviours, but in its broader, more expansive meaning. Her quest for freedom begins with a search for traces of humanity wherever they may be found, and it is from this place that her thirst for understanding the world’s diverse cultures emerges.

Kassis is a visual artist and writer who has been living in Paris for several years. She is currently working on a book that explores a range of ideas related to human development, delving into the depths of mythology to uncover its earliest sources. In this conversation, conducted in Paris, we navigate her thoughts and perspectives on contemporary human and intellectual issues.

**The Arab world’s estrangement from scientific facts and its clinging to superstition and obsolete ideas—do you think this explains why Arabs are still classified among developing or ‘underdeveloped’ countries?**

Undoubtedly, a society’s intellectual condition plays a fundamental role in determining its classification. Thought is the foundation of creativity and innovation across all domains, which in turn drives intellectual and scientific output. The fruits of such production ultimately lead to economic prosperity. We must begin by liberating the mind and expanding research across all fields in order to establish a solid economy—not the other way around. The mere possession of natural resources is insufficient to classify a nation as advanced. What use are resources if they are not deployed in service of societal and individual progress? In my view, creativity is the primary driver of all forms of advancement—it is the bedrock of meaningful productivity.

**How would you assess the credibility of Arab media when it comes to disseminating knowledge and information? Is there intellectual stagnation in how information is relayed and discussed? And do you think some media outlets, particularly new satellite channels, are complicit in brainwashing the younger generation—conditioning them towards ignorance and blind submission to ideas espoused by fundamentalists and extremists?**

Certainly, our most pressing crisis lies in the dominance of ossified, change-resistant minds over Arab media institutions. These entities are quick to distort any scientific knowledge misaligned with their worldview, as part of their ongoing campaign of brainwashing designed to preserve their power. The goal of circulating false or manipulated information ultimately serves the interests of religious authorities and authoritarian governments. We must recognise that these regimes work hand-in-hand with religious institutions to preserve a weak and fragile collective identity. It is far easier to control a population steeped in ignorance and kept under the yoke of oppression. A free human being, on the other hand, cannot be governed by any obscurantist force.

**The concept of freedom of thought and expression differs markedly between Western and Arab societies. Even in the West, there are red lines that must not be crossed in the media. As a member of the Arab Association for the Defence of Freedom of Expression, what are the boundaries of the freedom you advocate?**

Freedom, by its very nature, should have no boundaries. It is the cornerstone of progress and creative output. We must advocate for the liberation of the individual from the constraints of the collective, and from the seductive phrases that mask systems of control. This cannot be achieved without a heightened individual awareness. We can only reach this point by critically examining all beliefs, concepts, and ideologies. Critical thinking in itself prompts an individual to critique their own ego, which in turn cultivates the ability to listen to and accept others. When we recognise that our understanding is partial, and that truth is often revealed only through trial and error, and when we appreciate that the various schools of thought and knowledge are not mutually exclusive but complementary—only then can we traverse vast intellectual distances in awareness and understanding, ultimately arriving at true freedom.

**Does the concept of human rights and freedom of thought extend to the right to wear the burqa and cover one’s face in Paris—as opposed to Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran, or some Arab states? Can the hijab or burqa be considered a personal freedom that should not be challenged?**

One cannot speak of personal freedom if the individual in question does not believe in the concept of freedom itself. The burqa symbolises a repressive, radical ideology that seeks to erase the existence of the ‘other’ and denies them their liberty. How can we defend their right to express their desires when we know that the use of our own liberal values is merely a tool they exploit to cancel and harm us? Can freedom be granted to someone who does not believe in it? We know all too well that the ideology behind the burqa is tyrannical and obscurantist, aiming to silence dissent and impose a singular human identity. I believe it is the duty of every freedom-loving individual to resist this threat that seeks to drag us back into the darkness of ignorance.

**A writer once remarked that your use of the term 'intellectual rape' in a television interview on Channel 24 was a powerful and precise description of the condition of Muslim women. What do you mean by that phrase?**

Intellectual rape strips a woman of her sense of self. She becomes consumed with seeking male approval, working relentlessly to uphold patriarchal ideals in exchange for social validation in a male-dominated culture. We see her defending her abusers with astonishing fervour, often attacking anyone who tries to rescue her from the mire of obscurity. How can we explain her devotion to servitude and glorification of her oppressors, if not through a form of intellectual paralysis? I believe such paralysis results from prolonged psychological rape and daily brainwashing. She becomes a disfigured human being—more akin to a machine programmed to serve others.

**We understand you’re working on an important intellectual and research-based book about the evolution of human knowledge. Could you give us a glimpse of its contents?**

My interest in understanding natural and human evolution has led me to immerse myself in various scientific theories. I believe only in human efforts grounded in science. That is why I’ve chosen to bring together several psychological theories and examine the intersections between them in order to offer interpretations and insights that might help us better understand human nature. Furthermore, the widespread tendency among people to resort to mythical thinking when interpreting various phenomena has pushed me to investigate myths and trace their origins to our biological drives. This forms the core of the book’s second section.

**You’re also a painter and have held several solo exhibitions. Has your focus on writing and research distanced you from art and painting?**

I believe human life unfolds in phases, and I also believe in the need for change when the moment calls for it. Just as I believe in the transformations that shape our natural and social systems, I also believe that the richness of the individual self lies in our ability to change the frameworks and tools through which we express ourselves. Writing gives me a broader space to explore the ideas within me, allowing them to emerge freely onto the page and dance with words — infused with a liberating vitality that rejects any form of imposed methodology.
