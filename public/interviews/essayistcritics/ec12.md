Randa Kassis began her career as a visual artist before turning to psychological and anthropological research and writing. Following the outbreak of the Syrian uprising, she entered the political arena, heading the General Assembly of the Secular Democratic Coalition and representing it in the Syrian National Council. She later resigned due to disagreements over the arming of the opposition, the Council’s failure to condemn certain explosions and unlawful conduct by elements of the Free Syrian Army, and disputes over the growing dominance of the Muslim Brotherhood and Islamist factions within the revolutionary movement. She is currently president of the Movement for a Pluralistic Society, which she founded in September 2012 and which brings together activists from both inside Syria and abroad.

We met her in Paris, where she now lives, for the following conversation:

**'The sun will set at half past eight, God willing, and rise at five o’clock, God willing', say presenters of Arabic radio and television news bulletins. Regardless of how amusing or irrational the phrase may sound, how do you, as a writer and anthropological researcher, and the author of The Dungeons of the Gods, interpret this magical worldview?**

Human beings generally feel helpless in the face of an external world they do not understand. Societies rooted in religion tend to rely entirely on metaphysics to interpret what they cannot grasp, owing to deeply ingrained mental images shaped by social culture. These images obstruct individual imagination, forming barriers that prevent it from reaching its creative potential across scientific and intellectual domains. People in such societies, therefore, develop an absolute belief in fate and divine will, often resorting to phrases like 'God willing' whenever they face situations beyond their control or comprehension.

**How do you interpret the passivity of some Arab intellectuals in the face of rising superstition? Why have they failed to confront this form of mental regression decisively?**

Arab intellectuals often lack the psychological tools necessary to absorb external inputs that challenge their cultural framework. They are themselves bound by the same historical legacy and cultural uniformity that restrict individual capacity to break psychological barriers or introduce meaningful changes to prevailing models. Their reluctance to confront their environment often leads to resignation and compliance. Let us not forget that the mental images derived from religious culture entrap individuals within false values that conflict with their psychological constitution. These images become entrenched as unshakable truths, dominating the minds of their adherents—Arab intellectuals among them.

**You’ve written that you composed The Crypts of the Gods not to refute or confirm religions and moral doctrines, but to explore the dungeons of the self from which they arose. Could you give us a brief journey into the Arab self and its inner depths?**

In the book, I discuss various theories regarding the origins of gods and spirituality, aiming to illuminate their early ideas, which, over time, have branched out and evolved into dungeons from which individuals struggle to escape—particularly when they are burdened by a rigid social culture that crushes anyone who tries to break free. Even today, the figure of God continues to embody all the conflicting psychological struggles, as well as the desire of one group to dominate another. This suggests that the concept of God in these societies has yet to reach any form of spiritual maturity among its believers and remains in a state of primal emergence.

Meanwhile, religion has extended beyond its psychological roots to present itself as legislator, teacher, moral guide, and executioner, spreading like an octopus over the collective mind of society. It has reduced the individual to someone concerned solely with fulfilling basic survival needs. Religion penetrates everyday life to facilitate control and subjugation, creating long-term suffering and a chronic sense of dissatisfaction.

**What prompted your call for a National Hymen-Deflowering Day in patriarchal societies stifled by taboos?**

The hymen encapsulates an entire cultural system founded on gender discrimination. It reduces the woman to a mere instrument of male desire, turning the hymen into a moral yardstick that confines her to a narrow framework, compelling her to preserve it in order to receive society’s seal of approval. In such a context, the man becomes the woman’s ultimate aspiration, rather than her striving for self-realisation. The article was a form of rebellion against the hymen’s enslaving symbolism in these societies. It expressed a profound desire for change and the affirmation of individual worth, free from any form of discrimination.

**Could you expand on your view of the relationship between sex, religion, and freedom?**

Sexual desire is a biological need, no different from other essential human needs. How it is managed is a matter of personal conviction, and the pursuit of pleasure is, ultimately, an individual choice. However, our religious societies, ensnared by the cult of virtue, have managed to turn these instincts from private matters into sacred taboos and dogmas. Sexuality has become the unconscious driving force behind much of the societal mindset. We find entire cultures built on the taboo of sexual desire.

I believe our brief journey through life begins with a fundamental quest: the human being’s effort to reconcile with their instincts and inner self. It is only through this reconciliation that one can achieve a balance between the individual and collective self, paving the way towards an expanded, transformative consciousness.

**What do you mean by the phrase 'prison of virtue'?**

Psychological maturity involves integrating and reconciling one’s inner emotional contradictions to gain control over behaviour. Consciousness is a mutable state, constantly evolving in response to a deeper understanding of the world. The more society demands idealised conduct and traps individuals in abstract notions of virtue, the more it severs them from their instincts, needs, and unconscious drives. This separation distances them from the values imposed by their community.

The tendency to homogenise truth, knowledge, and awareness—to impose fixed ideals of perfection and virtue—is nothing more than a mechanical process, one devoid of curiosity, discovery, or genuine transformation.
