<b>Summary:</b>

The Arab revolutions—particularly in Egypt and Syria—remain fundamentally unfinished. One year after the fall of figures such as Mubarak, it became evident that the removal of dictators did not equate to systemic change. Egypt’s military establishment continued to dominate the political landscape, exposing the illusion of swift democratic transition.

The post-revolutionary phase witnessed the ascendancy of Islamist parties—notably the Muslim Brotherhood and Salafists—whose electoral success reflected organisational preparedness more than the ideals of the youth who had ignited the uprisings. Revolutionary momentum was thus absorbed by religious forces with entrenched agendas, marginalising secular voices and deepening societal polarisation.

For Kassis, the revolutions revealed a more profound struggle—not merely against autocratic regimes, but against deep-seated religious, patriarchal, and tribal hierarchies. The increasing role of Islam in politics, often ambiguous or intolerant, threatened individual freedoms and minority rights, effectively replacing one form of authoritarianism with another. Incidents such as the Port Said massacre underscored both the security vacuum and the army’s dual role as both enforcer and power broker.

International reactions laid bare stark geopolitical interests. Libya saw intervention due to Gaddafi’s isolation, whereas Syria’s entrenched alliances with Russia and Iran shielded Assad from similar action. Western rhetoric on universal values appeared selective, reinforcing Kassis’s view that human rights are frequently subordinated to strategic calculations.

Nevertheless, the revolutions initiated profound cultural shifts. The mobilisation of ordinary citizens, the use of social media, and the challenge to elite dominance represented a historic rupture. While Tunisia and Jordan a degree of flexibility, Egypt and Syria descended into repression and conflict.

Kassis contends that, despite their failures, the uprisings disrupted old certainties. A new generation began questioning inherited beliefs, seeking fresh political and existential frameworks. The revolutions may not have ushered in democracy, but they laid bare the urgent need for new imaginaries—secular, pluralistic, and emancipatory—that are capable of confronting the region’s deeper crises.
