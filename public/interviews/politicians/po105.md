Guest: Randa Kassis  

<b>Summary:</b>

In this special coverage, Randa Kassis offers a sharp and nuanced assessment of the Syrian conflict, accusing the Assad regime of deliberately exploiting sectarian divisions as a means of retaining power. By instilling fear among minority communities and rewriting the recent history of coexistence, the regime, she argues, seeks to sow division and weaken the opposition from within.

Kassis highlights the internal challenges facing the opposition, noting its lack of political experience, organisational cohesion, and strategic vision. She stresses the need for a unified front capable of presenting clear political and economic programmes that extend beyond the mere goal of regime change. Strengthening the link between grassroots protesters and political bodies, she argues, is essential for any meaningful transformation.

Expressing scepticism towards the regime’s engagement with the Arab League initiative, Kassis maintains that the internationalisation of the Syrian crisis has become inevitable, given the regime’s intransigence and the ineffectiveness of regional diplomatic efforts. She notes that the caution shown by global powers—particularly due to Syria’s strategic location and the Israeli factor—has contributed to the delay in decisive action.

On the societal level, she acknowledges the legitimate fears of minority groups and interprets the rise of Islamist currents as a natural reaction to prolonged repression. Nonetheless, she insists on the necessity of an inclusive, secular framework that safeguards all communities and prevents the descent into sectarian conflict.

Kassis concludes with an urgent appeal for international civilian protection, including the establishment of safe zones. Such measures, she asserts, are vital to enabling broader military defections and paving the way for a peaceful transition.
