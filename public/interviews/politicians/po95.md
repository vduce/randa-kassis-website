**SYRIA: Opponents Launch a Secular Movement** _Le Nouvel Observateur_ 11 October 2012

“We are fighting for the fall of Bashar al-Assad and for a Syria that upholds human rights,” stated the movement’s president, Randa Kassis.

Where does the Syrian opposition stand today? On Wednesday morning, as the president of the Syrian National Council (SNC)—the main opposition body in exile—was giving evidence to the Foreign Affairs Committee of the French National Assembly in Paris, a new opposition movement was being launched just a few hundred metres away.

Fragmentation and division have weakened the SNC, which was once regarded as the umbrella organisation for nearly the entire opposition. Over the months, it has lost a significant number of members, including its spokesperson, Basma Kodmani, who stepped down on 28 August.

Randa Kassis, founder of the new Movement for a Pluralistic Society, also left the SNC several months ago. “I’m not here to criticise the SNC,” she said, “but it is being manipulated by a political group that has long been funding extremist Islamists in Syria. That is why I resigned,” explained the Syrian writer.

**Minorities**

The new actor on the scene, which Kassis presents from exile, is primarily aimed at the country’s minorities—communities that have long been instrumentalised by Bashar al-Assad, who, like his father before him, has portrayed himself as an Alawite protector of minority groups.

“We must work with all those who still believe in secularism and pluralism in Syria, so that we can establish a political framework once Assad falls. To that end, we have begun working with the Local Coordination Committees. Our aim is to cooperate with all components of Syrian society. Our movement includes Alawite, Druze, Kurdish, Syriac, and secular Sunni Syrians—people from across the entire spectrum of society! We are united by a common goal: the fall of Bashar al-Assad and the establishment of a Syria that respects human rights,” she declared at the founding of the movement, joined by Abdaziz Othman, a member of the Kurdish National Council, Bassam Ishak, founder of the Syriac National Council, and Saleh S., an activist from the Local Coordination Committees.

**A Partitioned Syria?**

Randa Kassis left Syria at the age of 17, first for Germany and then France. Involved in the revolution from the outset—albeit from abroad—she joined the SNC and, a year ago, co-founded the Coalition of Secular and Democratic Syrians (CSDS). “I’m of Christian origin but secular in outlook,” she says, and her ambition is to speak to all Syrians. “We all interact with people from different communities—why should it be any different in the future Syria?” she asks.

While fierce fighting continues across the country, she firmly rejects any notion of partition, ruling out the idea of a Syrian federation made up of micro-confessional states. “It is far too early to talk about such things. Besides, we could only ever divide the country along geographical lines. It would be unthinkable to carve up Syria based on identities or religions. It simply wouldn’t make sense—populations are not distributed according to such criteria. There are large Christian communities in Homs, Damascus and Aleppo. And while the east has a significant Kurdish population, there are also a million Kurds living between Damascus and Aleppo. What would become of them?”

Will her proposals be enough to rally significant support? At a time when the country is increasingly influenced by Islamist factions—ranging from the Muslim Brotherhood to Salafist groups—it seems unlikely that this new secular structure will be able to compete with established parties or recently formed movements backed by foreign powers. Nevertheless, it will contribute to ensuring that a secular voice continues to be heard on the Syrian political stage.
