A long-standing opponent of the Syrian regime and founding president of the Movement for a Pluralistic Society, Randa Kassis recently published Le Chaos Syrien (with Alexandre del Valle, Dhow Editions, 2014).

<b>You were formerly a member of the Syrian National Council, which sought to unite various strands of the opposition. Today, however, you advocate for a broad national dialogue involving all elements of the Syrian political spectrum, including the Ba’ath Party. But isn’t it unrealistic to expect Bashar al-Assad to relinquish power?</b>

It is evident that Bashar al-Assad has no intention of stepping down. However, the key to breaking this deadlock lies in Moscow. We must move forward step by step. The immediate priority is to combat radical Islamist groups by supporting Kurdish fighters, while simultaneously reopening dialogue with the Damascus regime—with Russian backing. When I speak of a political and negotiated solution, this should not be mistaken for complacency or weakness.

<b>So the fight against the Islamic State has become your principal objective. Can this terrorist group be eradicated without a ground operation?</b>

Certainly not. The international coalition must maintain its air strikes in support of ground operations led by the Kurds. We must fight on two fronts: first, the military front—by arming Kurdish fighters; and second, through political negotiations between the opposition and the Assad regime, with Russia acting as mediator. This process began at the end of January. I hope that Western countries will soon choose to engage.

<b>Turkey, a Western ally, recently conducted an incursion into territory held by the Islamic State to retrieve the remains of the grandfather of the founder of the Ottoman Empire. Not a single shot was fired, nor was any combat reported. Can Ankara still be regarded as an objective ally—or is it, in fact, a complicit partner of the Islamic State?</b>

Erdogan’s Turkey has consistently obstructed peace efforts in Syria. It is widely suspected of supporting the Islamic State and facilitating the movement of jihadists across the Turkish-Syrian border. How can we continue to tolerate the criminal actions of Sultan Erdogan, when his country is ostensibly an ally of France within NATO? Personally, I am convinced that Erdogan’s Turkey is not a reliable partner for the West, and that its so-called 'moderate Islam' is no better than radical Islam.

<b>Some have pointed to the role of the Gulf states in the Islamisation of the Syrian uprising…</b>

The petromonarchies—particularly Qatar, but also certain Saudi and Kuwaiti princes—have financed several radical groups in Syria. These states have thoroughly undermined the credibility of the armed opposition by rendering its various brigades financially dependent on corrupt monarchies aligned with the most extreme forms of radical Islam.

As a result, many of the armed rebels have turned against the very idea of the nation-state, instead embracing the Salafist ideology that seeks to establish an Islamic Ummah—a transnational community that transcends borders. This vision is deeply rooted in Saudi Wahhabism, which continues to export its rigid, puritanical interpretation of Islam across the globe.
