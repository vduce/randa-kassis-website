<h4>From Ukraine to Iran, the Lines of the Multipolar World Are Shifting!</h4>

Le Dialogue

By Alexandre Del Valle  

Randa Kassis, a Franco-Syrian politician and President of the Movement for a Pluralistic Society, served as co-president of the Syrian secular and democratic opposition delegation during the Geneva talks. In 2015, she launched the Astana Platform, which has since brought together Syrian opposition figures on multiple occasions. In this context, she has held repeated meetings with Russian, Turkish, Western, and Saudi officials, among others. Here, she offers a compelling and sharply perceptive analysis of the current global landscape and the West’s strategic shortcomings.

<b>Randa Kassis, you closely follow global geopolitical developments through your work as a Syrian opposition figure seeking a path out of crisis. You have also regularly engaged with senior American, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Russian officials. Do you believe 2023 will be a year of de-escalation, or perhaps even resolution? Is the worst now behind us?</b>

I’m not so optimistic. For better or worse, all attention is currently focused on the war in Ukraine. Yet despite its strategic importance, many other countries are now being forgotten: Syria, Libya, Myanmar, Yemen – not to mention Afghan women, who have been abandoned to their fate – as well as Iraq, which continues to live in a state of chronic instability, and of course the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, alongside numerous other crises across the globe, especially in Africa. The United Nations is not merely inactive – it has become irrelevant. Take, for instance, the UN Special Envoy for Syria, Geir Pedersen. He has never attempted to break the deadlock in which he remains mired. Since his appointment, he has not proposed a single meaningful idea. In fact, he lives semi-retired in Oslo, rather than in Geneva, where he ought to be working to find solutions. As for 2023, I fear we may well see an Iran either in possession of nuclear weapons or, at the very least, capable of assembling one.

<b>Regarding the Russian-Ukrainian conflict and the broader confrontation between Russia and the West, which you follow closely, how do you respond to Western warmongers who are refraining from urging President Zelensky to negotiate and are instead supplying Ukraine with increasingly sophisticated weaponry? This aligns with the stated objectives of Presidents Biden and Macron, who speak openly of securing a ‘Russian defeat’—even the ‘recapture of all Ukrainian territory’, including Crimea. Are they right to reject any negotiations that do not begin with the non-negotiable recovery of all Ukrainian land?</b>

People are living under an illusion. I witnessed many doing so in Syria for years—for instance, when France, under the now-forgotten President François Hollande and his DGSE Director, Bernard Bajolet (now indicted for complicity in attempted extortion), believed themselves triumphant in the autumn of 2012… We know where that ultimately led. Tragically, Ukraine may prove no exception, despite its resistance and the influx of Western arms, which will not be sufficient to secure a military victory. Moreover, deeper Western involvement—such as the delivery of fighter jets—would only bring us closer to the edge of the abyss. According to the Pentagon, such deliveries would require between 12 and 24 months.

Personally, I do not for a moment believe in the full recovery of Ukrainian territory, let alone a Russian withdrawal.

<b>Do the sweeping European sanctions — including the latest measures on petroleum products, both crude and refined, as well as the price cap — stand any chance of becoming effective and forcing the Kremlin and its leader, Vladimir Putin, to yield?</b>

No. It is abundantly clear that these measures have had no tangible impact on Russian exports. Crude oil exported to India is evidently being refined there and subsequently sold back to Europe. Moreover, many countries across the globe are not adhering to these sanctions. On the contrary, some are actively cooperating with the Russian state to circumvent Western restrictions.

<b>Are the Europeans being taken for fools?</b>

Most European countries have trapped themselves in a belligerent narrative, while the United States will eventually reposition itself in accordance with its own interests—once it acknowledges that China is its principal adversary and that Iran stands on the brink of acquiring nuclear weapons. That will alter the equation entirely.

The Americans will do what they do best: they will abandon the Ukrainians in a war-ravaged country, gradually reducing financial support month by month. And then, what will the Europeans do? I suspect they’ll be caught with their trousers down, wearing a stunned expression as they turn to their operetta-style “new Bismarck” – the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen – in search of a solution that either no longer exists or never did.

<b>Are the United States profiting from the Ukrainian and energy crisis, which has primarily affected Europe?</b>

Absolutely. The Europeans are now buying more shale gas, despite it being economically unsustainable in the medium to long term. But the United States is pursuing a vassalised Europe—even if some countries, such as Hungary, are resisting.

<b>Is Putin deluding himself when he claims his war in Ukraine is the epicentre of a global struggle between an emerging multipolar world and the “Western imperialists”?</b>

It is certainly an exaggeration, but there is no doubt that we now live in a multipolar world, and that the American myth has crumbled. Moreover, the emerging world is not at war in Ukraine—countries such as Brazil, India, Indonesia, and South Africa, for instance, are not involved—but they have grown weary of American diktats and, notably, are not enforcing sanctions against Russia. We recently witnessed a striking example of this in the agreement between Iran and Saudi Arabia, brokered under China’s auspices on 14 March 2023. It underscored China’s growing influence on the global stage. Meanwhile, the United States finds itself increasingly sidelined in various parts of the world, including Latin America, where its influence has all but evaporated.

<b>In Turkey, President Erdoğan also seems to be benefitting from the Ukrainian crisis. But what would become of Turkey’s position if the secular Kemalist coalition wins the upcoming June elections?</b>

One must adopt a measured perspective when assessing any potential shift in Turkish foreign policy should the CHP-led (Kemalist) coalition prevail. Admittedly, their stance may be less provocative and confrontational, but on major geopolitical issues, they are unlikely to implement any significant changes. It is worth noting that several key figures from Erdoğan’s former governments—such as Ahmet Davutoğlu and Ali Babacan—are now allied with the CHP within the current coalition.

<b>As a Syrian opposition figure, what are the direct and indirect consequences of the Ukrainian crisis on the Syrian dossier?</b>

The Syrian file has been abandoned—by Europe, the United States, and the United Nations alike. There is no longer a coherent strategy or guiding framework. The West is wholly preoccupied with Ukraine. It is also worth noting that countries once heavily involved in the Syrian issue—notably Saudi Arabia and Qatar—have now moved closer to Moscow, particularly Mohammed bin Salman, who has all but severed ties with the United States in under five years.

<b>With Benjamin Netanyahu’s return to power in Israel, supported by a hard-right and religious far-right coalition that is far less moralistic and considerably more neutral towards Russia than Lapid’s government, could Israel now assume a new role as a mediator rivalling Turkey in negotiations between the Russians, Ukrainians, and Americans?</b>

Netanyahu is navigating a political minefield, surrounded by burdensome allies with conflicting interests. He is engaged in an almost open conflict with Mossad and Shin Bet, which complicates his ability to adopt a clear stance on sensitive matters such as Ukraine.

<b>Do you see any real difference between the foreign policies of Joe Biden and Donald Trump regarding Russia, the European Union, and Ukraine, bearing in mind that the Trump administration had already armed Kyiv and strongly opposed Nord Stream 1 and 2?</b>

The large-scale armament of Ukraine is a hallmark of the Biden administration. While the Trump administration—aside from its formal withdrawal from the JCPOA (Iran nuclear deal)—was characterised by erratic and often contradictory statements and actions, especially concerning Nord Stream, it never truly sought to confront Russia. In contrast, Biden has consistently adopted a fundamentally anti-Russian stance and has been far more proactive in this regard.

<b>Given that Washington bears some responsibility for the failure to implement the Minsk I and II agreements and for NATO’s eastward expansion, will the United States only urge Zelensky to negotiate – to freeze the conflict – once American public opinion grows weary of the nearly $100 billion spent on Ukraine, or if Russia escalates to a credible nuclear threat?</b>

It is plausible that a Republican return to power in the United States would affirm that China, rather than Russia, is now perceived as the primary strategic threat. In fact, Congress is already showing signs of fatigue over the tens of billions funnelled into Ukraine.

Russia is prepared to wage this war for as long as necessary, which may ultimately wear down Western support and increase pressure on Zelensky to enter negotiations. At that point, the West’s bellicose strategy may reach its limits: NATO neither possesses nor is producing sufficient munitions to sustain Ukraine’s current level of resistance indefinitely. Moreover, American anti-missile systems appear incapable of intercepting Russia’s new hypersonic missiles – even though Russia would need to scale up production significantly in order to pose a sustained threat.

<b>What is your 2023 forecast regarding the ongoing global economic crisis – particularly in Europe – and what are your scenarios concerning the risk of a world war or the outbreak of a new front in Taiwan or against the Iranian regime? Would you describe your outlook as pessimistic or merely cautious?</b>

If Iran were to acquire nuclear weapons – or even simply the capacity to assemble them – over the course of 2023, it would be highly risky for Israel to embark on a military confrontation without any assurance of success. In all likelihood, it is already too late. Saudi Arabia has clearly come to this realisation. China, by successfully brokering a rapprochement – or at least a de-escalation – between Saudi Arabia and Iran, has powerfully demonstrated its ability to undermine the United States. This may well form part of a deliberate Chinese strategy to weaken both the US and Europe, who would find it extremely difficult to mount an effective economic or political response in the event of an attack on Taiwan.

In the longer term, China could opt to impose a blockade on Taiwan. And frankly, it is hard to see how the West could prevent it. That said, China is far more measured than Moscow. It is methodically preparing itself and working to pre-empt or neutralise any effective countermeasures its Western rivals might attempt.
