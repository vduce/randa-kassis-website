<h4>Interview with Randa Kassis</h4>

Presented by Vincent Hervouet  

<b>Summary:</b>

Randa Kassis recounts her departure from the Syrian National Council and her decision to pursue an independent path—one that ultimately culminated in the publication of Le Chaos Syrien, co-authored with geopolitical analyst Alexandre del Valle. This 300-page work presents a sweeping analysis of the Syrian conflict, seeking to foster a deeper understanding of the country’s historical, social, and political intricacies, while exposing the flawed strategies that have defined international intervention.

Kassis challenges the dominant narrative that reduces the conflict to a binary confrontation between the Assad regime and a democratic opposition. She contends that Western powers, in their eagerness to see Bashar al-Assad removed, have gravely underestimated both the fragmentation of the opposition and the increasing dominance of jihadist movements. The West’s support for so-called “moderate” rebels has often proved misguided, as many of these groups are structurally weak, plagued by corruption, or ideologically ambiguous. Arms shipments destined for them have frequently ended up in the hands of the most radical factions.

She also highlights the duplicity of key regional actors—including Qatar and Saudi Arabia—who, while publicly participating in the international coalition against terrorism, continue to finance radical Islamist groups on the ground. Turkey, she notes, plays a similar double game: professing opposition to ISIS while enabling extremist fighters to train and operate from its territory with relative impunity.

Rather than persisting with a military strategy based on unreliable rebel alliances, Kassis calls for support to be redirected towards Kurdish forces, who have demonstrated both operational effectiveness and deep-rooted presence. More crucially, she advocates for the revival of a political process that includes negotiations with the Syrian regime—not out of ideological sympathy, but from a pragmatic recognition that no lasting resolution is possible without engaging with the existing power structure.

In Kassis’s view, the West has allowed emotional hostility and personal animosity towards Assad to cloud its judgement, overlooking the fact that the rise of jihadist totalitarianism represents a far more urgent and dangerous threat. After years of devastation and disillusionment, she argues that the time has come for a sober reassessment—one that sets aside wishful thinking in favour of a political solution rooted in realism, pluralism, and long-term stability.
