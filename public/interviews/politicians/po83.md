In Tangier to participate in the MEDays Forum, Mme Randa Kassis—a prominent figure in Syrian civil society and a leading secular voice in the opposition—graciously agreed to speak with La Nouvelle Tribune.

<b>Public opinion in Morocco is following the dire situation in Syria with both anguish and close attention. How do you assess the current state of affairs? Is this horrific civil war, now ongoing for months, likely to continue?</b>

It would take several hours to fully explain the crisis. But to summarise, Syria is facing an exceptionally complex situation. A political solution is imperative, and we must work towards establishing a transitional government at the conclusion of the Geneva II Conference—one that includes all factions of the opposition, as well as representatives from within the regime.

While I cannot predict how long the conflict will continue, I must stress the urgent need for a negotiated resolution. Geneva II is of critical importance—it is the only platform currently capable of easing tensions and laying the groundwork for a political framework that incorporates all segments of Syrian society.

<b>From the outside, the nuances of Syria’s political struggle and the divisions within the opposition are not always well understood. Could you clarify this for us?</b>

The Syrian opposition is not wholly represented by the National Coalition, which consists of barely more than a hundred members. That said, I welcome the decision to move forward with the Geneva II process. The objective is to advance negotiations and, eventually, establish a transitional government. The status quo is unsustainable.

<b>How do you view the Syrian opposition’s decision to participate in Geneva II, particularly given the conditions some observers see as unrealistic?</b>

At this point, I do not think it helpful to speak of preconditions. The priority must be to bring all stakeholders to the negotiating table. Only then can meaningful dialogue begin.

<b>It appears that atrocities are being committed not only by Bashar al-Assad’s forces but also by certain armed groups opposed to him. What is your view?</b>

Indeed, some jihadist and Salafist rebel factions have committed unspeakable atrocities. It is absolutely accurate to state that responsibility for the bloodshed does not lie solely with the Assad regime. Foreign fighters—so-called 'rebels'—have arrived in Syria to wage their own ideological war. Tragically, it is the Syrian people who continue to bear the brunt of the violence.

<b>What is your reaction to the presence of armed groups on the ground who openly identify with Al-Qaeda? Do you believe Syria still has a secular future?</b>

Horror. Without wishing to exacerbate matters, I am deeply convinced that many of these rebel-held areas are intent on transforming Syria into an Islamic state governed by Sharia law.

This vision utterly ignores the existence of the 35 to 40 percent of Syrians who belong to secular minorities—including secular Sunnis—who now see their society torn apart by unrelenting conflict. In my view, Syria’s future must be both secular and federal. This is the only way to protect our minorities—who are Syria’s true wealth—and to safeguard the freedoms and rights of all citizens.

<b>What does your presence in Morocco, and specifically at the MEDays Forum in Tangier, represent?</b>

I came to Morocco—and to Tangier in particular—to participate in the MEDays Forum and to speak openly about the Syrian crisis. Syria’s plight is extraordinarily complex. It involves questions of national identity, coexistence among diverse communities, and the country’s geostrategic role in both the region and the world. As I hope has become clear, it is vital that those of us in the opposition continue to expose the true nature of the struggle unfolding in Syria.
