**The Dreadful Toll of Ten Years of Syrian Chaos** _Valeurs Actuelles_ 17 March 2021 By Alexandre del Valle

Randa Kassis, who also heads the Movement for a Pluralistic Society — uniting secularists, Christians, Kurds, Alawites, Sunnis, and other ethnic, religious, and ideological minorities — is not a typical figure within the Syrian opposition. As staunchly anti-Islamist as she is critical of Bashar al-Assad, democratic yet pragmatic, she has participated in numerous Geneva negotiations as leader of the Astana Platform, as well as other intra-Syrian talks. She has consistently maintained her independence while navigating between Geneva, Moscow, Ankara, Astana, and Paris. Her work in parallel diplomacy, along with her political and intellectual influence, extends far beyond Syria’s borders.

In addition to championing the rights of minorities and women in the Arab world, her initiatives and writings have at times influenced Russian diplomacy and even the United Nations — particularly during the Astana talks, which, for the first time, brought together all Syrian factions at the same table without exclusion. Disillusioned by the narrow-mindedness and lack of strategic vision among Western actors, and sharply critical of Islamist groups and Erdogan’s Turkey, Randa Kassis remains committed to developing a new Syrian constitution as the cornerstone of an inclusive and gradual democratisation process.

While convinced that Assad’s continued grip on power is, in itself, an obstacle to peace, she refuses to make his departure a precondition — a miscalculation, in her view, made by many within the opposition. As early as 2017, she had already proposed the creation of a constitutional committee to facilitate peace, anticipating a move the United Nations would later endorse. Resolute in her pursuit of a solution, Kassis — who also co-founded the London-based AD-HOC Foundation, which unites secular activists and Muslim intellectuals such as the renowned poet Adonis, the secular essayist Waleed Al-Husseini, Kacem El-Ghazali, and Ayman Ghoujal — now seeks to offer a candid and unflinching assessment of the seemingly interminable “Syrian chaos”.

**What are your reflections on the tenth anniversary of the Syrian civil war, as a figure of the secular and democratic opposition — both against Bashar al-Assad’s regime and the Islamist fanatics who sought to turn Syria into a caliphate?**

I feel profound sadness. The country is in complete ruin. Everyone has lost — including Bashar al-Assad, who now presides over a shattered nation. Large segments of the population are suffering from famine or unable to access basic necessities. Reconstruction is paralysed by American and international sanctions. The state remains in ruins. Bashar resembles a bankruptcy trustee more than a genuine head of state.

**Is it the Syrian people who are paying the price for the American “Caesar Act,” which penalises any state or company involved in Syria’s reconstruction?**

Regrettably, yes. But these sanctions are the only means of jolting the Russians out of their lethargy and prompting them to consider a political process not based solely on their unconditional support for Bashar al-Assad. Russia’s prolonged hibernation has come at a great cost. Without sanctions, Bashar — and perhaps later his son — would remain in power indefinitely, making peace unattainable. That said, unlike some in the opposition, I do not chant “Bashar out” as a simplistic slogan. My vision for a constitutional committee is to draft a new constitution not under the auspices of the UN — a master of failure — but through the involvement of all actors without exception, including the Damascus regime.

If Bashar had any political foresight, he would endorse a modern constitution guaranteeing freedom of expression, social and political rights, and organise parliamentary elections capable of ushering in genuine pluralism.

**So, Assad’s departure is simply not realistic at this stage?**

No — we must first change mindsets, progressively. Sadly, the opposition recognised by the UN and the West — the High Negotiations Committee, which is largely dominated by Islamists — has fought against alternative, secular, and rational platforms. This hard-line opposition has been just as rigid and unproductive as the Assad regime, and has never initiated anything substantial for Syria. Some of its members even appropriated my ideas — the Astana Platform, which later evolved into the Astana Process (the meetings with Russia, Turkey, and Iran), and the constitutional committee launched at the 2017 Sochi conference — yet failed to make any real use of them.

The West erred in launching a political process with defected Syrian military officers, despite the fact that Moscow has never staked its hopes on army defectors — individuals it considers likely to betray again. It would have been far more pragmatic to unite civilian opposition figures with the regime, rather than attempt reconciliation between the regime and those it regards as traitors.

That said, Russia must recognise that Bashar al-Assad is a weak, ineffective, and neurotic ally with no vision for Syria’s future. What purpose does he serve, beyond handing out credit cards to his wife Asma so she can purchase the latest Louboutin shoes?

**And what of Al-Qaeda and Daesh in Syria?**

They still exist in the north. Al-Qaeda collaborates with Sunni rebel forces in the Turkish-controlled region of Idlib, with the tacit approval of Turkish military officers. Syrian rebels, Erdogan’s Turkey, and Al-Qaeda all share this territory and continue to fight the same Kurdish, secular Syrian enemy. As for Daesh, it still holds isolated pockets of territory and, as in Iraq, retains the capacity to re-emerge in certain areas — although I doubt it could ever again establish a functional state with a capital.

**What about the jihadist volunteers in Syria? What should be done with them?**

This is a genuine dilemma. The Kurds cannot keep them, and the Syrians — like the Iraqis — refuse to house them, particularly as many are not from the region. Both Arabs and Kurds are eager to be rid of them. Since we lack sufficient evidence to convict them outright, they should be tried in European courts under the charge of aggravated complicity — a legal category that would allow for long-term sentences for those who joined Daesh or Al-Qaeda, excluding minors.

**Is there any hope for a political process — one your group has attempted to advance?**

Unfortunately, no political process has succeeded — not even the one led by the United Nations. The Syrian Constitutional Committee (SCC) has yielded nothing. This was foreseeable. Geir O. Pedersen, the UN Special Envoy to Syria who succeeded Staffan de Mistura, adopted a doomed framework by engaging only with two sides: the regime on one hand, and the opposition bloc — dominated by Islamists and hostile to Kurds and alternative opposition groups — on the other. In short, he engaged the two most intransigent factions.

Pedersen is a special envoy devoid of ideas, energy, or an alternative vision — the quintessential parasitic UN diplomat and bureaucrat, solving nothing. Turkey and Russia have led him in circles. They have no faith in the UN process and pursue their own divergent agendas.

Russia’s primary concern — beyond keeping Bashar in power — is to lift sanctions, initiate reconstruction, and enable the return of refugees. But these refugees have no homes to return to. Believing in reconstruction and repatriation under such conditions is dangerously naïve.

The transfer of the Syrian dossier from the Ministry of Defence to the Russian Foreign Ministry signals stagnation. Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov will struggle to secure Syria’s return to the Arab League, a prospect currently blocked directly by Qatar and indirectly by Ankara and Washington. It is a shame — had Moscow opened negotiations to all factions, it could have united Syrians around a new constitution guaranteeing genuine pluralism, something its neurotic ally Bashar categorically rejects.

**Who bears responsibility for this diplomatic catastrophe?**

Everyone shares the blame. The West’s key error was recognising only one faction of the opposition — initially the Syrian National Council (SNC), followed by the Syrian Coalition and then the High Negotiations Committee — all of which were dominated by Islamists or groups beholden to Ankara. These factions could never realistically engage with the Kurds.

Turkey supported Islamist rebels, rejected pluralistic forces, and sabotaged peace efforts. It even deployed Syrian Islamists as mercenaries in Libya, Nagorno-Karabakh, and soon possibly in Kashmir, in alignment with Pakistan. Driven by ambitions of reviving leadership over the Muslim world, Erdogan is endangering any chance of lasting peace, while dismantling Turkey’s secularism and prosperity — once rare in the region.

As for Putin’s Russia, its insistence on preserving its alliance with Erdogan obstructs any viable political outcome. Ankara excluded the Kurds from negotiations and ensured that Islamists remained part of the opposition — including jihadist elements — particularly in Idlib, now effectively a “Turkish zone.”

Finally, the Islamist rebels and jihadists share responsibility for the bloodshed with the regime. As fanatical as Bashar — who remains fixated solely on preserving his rule — their singular aim is to Islamise Syria and, ultimately, humanity. They are pawns of foreign powers: Turkey and Qatar.

Yes, Bashar is primarily to blame for the chaos, having violently crushed peaceful protesters in 2011. But the civil war has claimed victims on all sides. Every actor, including the Islamists, has fuelled this conflict. As for the Europeans — the former “Friends of Syria” — they turned their backs once their strategy to topple Bashar failed. The cowardice of Brussels knows no bounds.
