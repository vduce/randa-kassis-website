Guests: Nasr al-Hariri & Randa Kassis

<b>Summary:</b>

The shifting role of American foreign policy—particularly in the wake of Donald Trump’s election—forms the focal point of this discussion, featuring two prominent figures: Randa Kassis and Nasr al-Hariri, who articulate markedly divergent positions regarding the implications of the incoming U.S. administration for Syria’s future.

Randa adopts a pragmatic and realist stance, expressing cautious optimism that Trump’s presidency could pave the way for a substantive political settlement through collaboration with Russia. She underscores the necessity of distinguishing between moderate and extremist factions within the opposition and advocates a diplomatic path that transcends ideological entrenchment and the futility of continued military engagement. Her approach reflects a belief in engaging both U.S. and Russian interests to unlock a political solution—however imperfect.

In contrast, Nasr al-Hariri assumes a rhetorical and uncompromising posture, echoing familiar slogans calling for the immediate removal of Bashar al-Assad, yet without offering a viable or coherent political strategy. His discourse, though couched in the language of justice and accountability, appears detached from the geopolitical realities on the ground. Rather than striving for a pragmatic political transition, Nasr and his delegation seem more preoccupied with seizing power, clinging to maximalist demands while failing to present a credible roadmap for governance or reconciliation. This insistence on regime change—absent a structured alternative—has repeatedly undermined efforts to unify the opposition and engage constructively in international negotiations.

Both interlocutors confront the role of external actors such as Russia and Iran. Randa acknowledges Russia’s destructive military campaign but argues for strategic engagement with Moscow as an indispensable stakeholder. Nasr is far more critical, viewing Russia as an enabler of Assad’s impunity and aggression. Both, however, recognise Iran’s destabilising influence through its sectarian militias and unwavering support for the regime.

The conversation also delves into the internal fragmentation of the Syrian opposition, particularly the contentious classification of “moderate” versus “extremist” armed groups. These divisions—compounded by ongoing violence and humanitarian catastrophe—are presented as major impediments to cohesive political representation and effective negotiation.

Regional dynamics feature prominently as well, with Turkey’s complex positioning, U.S. support for Kurdish forces, and the influence of the Saudi-Iranian rivalry adding further layers of complication. Both discussants underscore the indispensability of realpolitik and diplomatic realism, contending that durable peace requires inclusive dialogue involving all major international and regional stakeholders.

Finally, the debate converges on a shared premise: that only a genuine, inclusive political process—rooted in the Geneva communiqué, accountability, and the creation of a viable alternative to Assad’s regime—can offer Syrians a path out of devastation. Both voices caution against the repetition of rhetorical platitudes and failed interventions, calling instead for sober, concerted action grounded in justice and mutual compromise.

In sum, the exchange captures a compelling dialectic between hope and disillusionment, between pragmatic diplomacy and ethical imperatives—mirroring the broader tensions that have long plagued efforts to resolve Syria’s protracted conflict.
