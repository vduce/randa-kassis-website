**Interview with Randa Kassis, Syrian opposition figure and intellectual, spokesperson for the Coalition of Secular Forces and member of the Syrian National Council** _France Soir_ 01 November 2011

Following the Tunisian elections of 23 October, which marked a victory for the Islamist party Ennahda, Randa Kassis—a prominent secular Syrian opponent—explains why the rise of radical Islamism and the failure of secular forces are not inevitable.

**You are part of the Syrian opposition to Bashar al-Assad, and the spokesperson of the Coalition of Secular Syrian Forces. How do you respond to those who, after the Tunisian elections, claim that the original Arab revolutionaries—mostly secular and modern, connected through web networks but not organised into structured political parties—risk having their revolution stolen by Islamists?**

In recent decades, we have witnessed the rise of a radical Islamist ideology which, in my view, has reached its peak among Arab populations. This is due to several factors: the weakening of secular parties; the effective organisation of Islamist movements and their deep infiltration into the popular masses by playing a major social role. In addition, the sense of defeat caused by repeated failures has driven many into religious hysteria, leading them to believe that political Islam is the cure for all their ills.

At the same time, the censorship of freedom of expression and thought imposed by these dictatorial regimes—and let us not forget!—the support of the United States for these Islamist movements from the Cold War to the present day, also explain the success of parties affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood and Saudi Arabia.

However, the situation is not without hope. In Arabic, we have a saying: “The cure for a disease comes from the disease itself.” Perhaps we must accept a transitional period during which these movements will govern temporarily, and this will demonstrate to those who believe in this “magical cure” that Islamists will not be able to solve their problems—neither through faith nor through a political Islam based on the subjugation of the individual.

During this time, we—the secular and democratic forces—must unify and prepare both a cultural and political programme in order to raise awareness among these populations.

**Do you, like other analysts, believe that an international intervention in Syria is either impossible or extremely difficult, especially due to Russian and Chinese vetoes?**

A military air intervention by NATO, or the establishment of a no-fly zone, is technically feasible. What is lacking at the moment is the political will and determination of several countries to assist the Syrian people in toppling the Assad regime. I believe human relations are generally built upon cooperation for shared higher interests. In this case, the interest lies in building regional stability by warding off the spectre of civil war, which could plunge the entire region into chaos.

In the medium term, the objective would also be to break the Syrian-Iranian alliance and then block the path of the Islamists by eradicating all so-called “jihadist” movements. Viewed from this perspective, a military intervention or the establishment of a no-fly zone is entirely possible.

**How do you envision Syria’s future? Do you have an action plan to overthrow the Assad regime?**

Externally, it is true that the Syrian National Council (SNC) has been manipulated and financed by Islamists who have yet to develop a real roadmap to bring down Bashar al-Assad’s regime.

At present, Syrian secular and democratic forces are actively discussing the necessary steps in this direction and considering a firm stance towards the SNC, which has not even finalised its list of members and has excluded all secular and democratic opposition forces that participated in its conference from decision-making.

Internally, the Syrian streets remain agitated and determined to bring down the regime. I believe it is only a matter of time before opposition forces succeed in uniting democratically.

**How would you respond if Bashar al-Assad were to reach out to the opposition and finally propose democratisation measures?**

The Syrian people are the only legitimate judge, and it is for them to decide whether to extend a hand to their “child-killer.”

After so many victims have perished in daily massacres, I see no possibility of working with this totalitarian, repressive regime, which is incapable of changing its methods or halting its killing machine. All members of the opposition are compelled to follow the will of the people, who are clearly demanding Assad’s departure.

**Do you fear for the Alawite and Kurdish minorities, whom you know well, and for the Christians, if the Islamists were ever to seize power—whether through civil war or through elections following a regime change?**

In Syria, ethnic and religious minorities make up between 35% and 40% of the population. They are all secular, either out of self-preservation or survival. In addition, there are secular Sunnis who constitute 10% to 15% of the population.

Therefore, we can see that Islamists are incapable of imposing their way of life on half the Syrian population, which in such a case could respond forcefully and create significant instability in the country.

Moreover, let us not forget that secularists are beginning to gain experience and now have confidence in their capacity for mobilisation in the face of any totalitarian ideology. However, it is true that we cannot ignore the risk of civil war—a risk that could engulf the entire region if Assad does not very soon relinquish power to a pluralist transitional government.
