**Erdoğan Seeks to Establish Turkey as a New Regional Power on the Global Stage** _Elbalad News_ 16 July 2020

Randa Kassis, President of the Astana political platform, stated in an interview with French writer Alexandre del Valle for the French website Atlantico that the chaos in Libya bears notable similarities to that in Syria, even though the social, ethnic, and religious contexts are entirely different. She asserted that it is no secret that Syrian Islamist and Turkmen fighters were recently redeployed by Turkey—by the thousands—from the theatre of war in western Syria to Libya, in order to support the head of the Libyan Government of National Accord, Fayez al-Sarraj, against the Commander-in-Chief of the Libyan National Army, Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar, who is backed by Egypt, the UAE, Russia, and France.

Despite Erdoğan’s rhetoric concerning the Libyan “brothers” of Anatolian descent—whom he presents as remnants of the Ottoman legacy and its Islamic ideology—Kassis added that the Turkish President is defined by pragmatism and an insatiable thirst for power, seeking to position himself as a leader for millions of Muslims. He is actively pursuing Turkish influence across various regions, with Libya in particular offering access to Morocco, sub-Saharan Africa, and the Mediterranean coastline.

When asked about Erdoğan’s support for the establishment of military, political, and economic footholds aligned with Turkey—facilitating Turkish trade agreements with numerous African nations—Kassis noted that Erdoğan possesses an ambitious and strategic vision aimed at gradually positioning Turkey as a global player, simultaneously active in multiple regions. This raises the question: under Erdoğan’s leadership, does Turkey aspire to elevate itself to the status of a regional power akin to Russia or the United States?

In response, Kassis said that, in her view, there is no doubt that Turkey is seizing every opportunity afforded by geostrategic vacuums in Syria and Libya to assert its presence in the Middle East, parts of the Arab world, and Africa. At the same time, she cautioned against underestimating Erdoğan’s domestic political agenda, highlighting his use of international leverage to restore his popularity—particularly following his significant setback in the 2019 local elections, when he was defeated by opposition candidates from the Republican People’s Party.

This Turkish-Islamist expansion—whether in Syria, parts of the Mediterranean (such as the vast offshore Greek gas reserves), certain Arab countries, the Cyprus issue and the Aegean islands, or in Libya (for access to Africa and oil), or in the defence of Palestinian rights—can all be instrumentalised domestically to secure political survival. The strategic exploitation of foreign policy for internal gain is hardly unique to Erdoğan; all states, to varying degrees, manipulate international affairs to weaken domestic opposition and prolong their rule.

Kassis concluded by affirming that Erdoğan is indeed intent on asserting Turkey as a major regional power—effectively, as an international actor—thereby reinforcing its geopolitical position. In doing so, he also fortifies his own leadership, portraying himself as a national figure capable of securing access to energy resources and influence across Africa.
