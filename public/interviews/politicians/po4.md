Randa Kassis, anthropologist, Franco-Syrian politician and writer, and president of the Movement for a Pluralistic Society, is a prominent figure within the opposition to the former Ba’athist regime of Bashar al-Assad—toppled not by democratic forces, but by coalitions of Islamist and jihadist Sunni rebels, primarily backed by Qatar and, above all, Turkey.

Since then, Western media outlets and European capitals have tirelessly sought to justify the growing international recognition of the “moderate throat-slitters” of HTS and its leader, Abu Mohammed al-Joulani—now reverting to his real name, Ahmed al-Charaa—by rebranding them as “moderate.” This makeover coincides with his recent adoption of Western attire and concerted efforts to present both himself and his de facto regime as respectable and legitimate. His underlying motivation is, of course, the lifting of international sanctions, particularly American ones—most notably the Caesar Act—which continue to hinder Syria’s reconstruction and maintain strict embargoes and restrictions on imports, exports, and international financial transactions.

Freshly returned from Syria—where she visited Alawite, Druze, and Christian minority communities across the country before arriving in the capital, Damascus—Randa Kassis shares her exclusive account with Atlantico and offers insight into the true nature of the emerging power in Damascus. In stark contrast to the dominant narratives and the waves of euphoria spreading across Western circles in response to the rise of Joulani-Charaa, Kassis firmly rejects the notion that this new, albeit fragile, ruler of Damascus and his ex-jihadist group have somehow transformed into an “inclusive” force, suddenly “tolerant” of minorities and secularists or on a credible path towards “democracy.”

Analysts not fooled by what is likely an exercise in taqiya understand that Joulani’s apparent signs of moderation are chiefly driven by a strategic aim: securing relief from crippling sanctions. This view is not limited to sceptics—Emmanuel Macron himself echoed this line of reasoning during a recent phone call with Ahmed al-Charaa on 7 February, in which the Élysée reportedly extended an invitation to the Syrian leader to visit Paris in the near future.

<b>What do you make of Emmanuel Macron’s proposal to meet Al-Joulani / Al-Charaa as part of an official invitation to Paris? Is Macron being pragmatic, naïve, or simply riding a wave akin to the “Zelensky syndrome”?</b>

How can a European, Western democratic head of state like President Macron invite a known terrorist leader such as Al-Joulani? I believe our Western leaders ought to act with far greater caution—especially after the episode in Afghanistan just three years ago, when the Taliban made similar promises of having become “moderate” to gain international recognition, only to swiftly

revert to their radical Islamist policies. Women were stripped of their rights, and a totalitarian form of sharia was reimposed.

Our politicians should have learnt from that painful experience—not only for women, but for all communities deprived of their basic rights. Even the mere act of congratulating a former jihadist who has unilaterally declared himself “president” (like Joulani / Al-Charaa)—without any electoral process or democratic legitimacy, and based solely on the approval of a few Islamist brigades—is astonishing.

It is worth highlighting that the majority of brigades within the Syrian National Army (SNA) and those in the south (such as Ahmad al-Awdeh’s Southern Operations Room) have not endorsed this self-appointment of Joulani / Al-Charaa. As for Macron’s invitation to the jihadist leader to visit Paris—which now appears to have been shelved—how can one even conceive of inviting into a democracy a former leader of Daesh and Al-Qaeda, who remains on international terrorist watchlists for orchestrating and committing countless crimes over the years?

Furthermore, it is important to point out that Macron’s phone call to Joulani took place just two days after the CEO of CMA CGM—the French shipping company headed by Franco-Lebanese businessman Rodolphe Saadé—was appointed to manage the port of Latakia…

<b>What should we take away from the recent official visit of Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov to Syria? Do the Russians still believe their military bases in Tartus and Hmeimim can be maintained or renegotiated?</b>

To my knowledge, the Russians are indeed engaged in ongoing negotiations to retain their two strategic military bases in Syria. However, the compensation demands put forward by Al-Charaa / Joulani are not entirely to their liking. The fundamental issue lies in Al-Charaa’s lack of understanding of international political dynamics. While he may currently enjoy the support of two or three regional powers, such backing is far from sufficient to navigate the complexities of today’s geopolitical landscape.

His administration, devoid of both experience and strategic foresight, has already committed several significant blunders. He finds himself confronted with an emerging global order without truly grasping its mechanisms. As for Russia, it has yet to make a definitive choice regarding him and appears, for now, to be maintaining a cautious diplomatic posture—a form of hedging—while it monitors how the situation unfolds.

<b>During your recent stay in Syria, you met with leaders of the country’s main minority communities. What is your assessment of the so-called “moderate” ex-jihadist Islamist regime now in place in Damascus?</b>

We met with representatives of most Syrian communities, including Christians—among them Patriarch John X of the Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch and All the East—and Sheikh Hikmat al-Hijri, the spiritual leader of Syria’s Druze Unitarian community. All expressed various degrees of concern and apprehension. I therefore stand in clear opposition to this radical regime, which is anything but democratic. In Damascus, as in other parts of the country, people are living in fear. There is a palpable anxiety about the potential for renewed civil war.

The overwhelming majority of communities we encountered reject the prospect of a religious dictatorship or the imposition of sharia law. This includes secular Sunnis, Sufis, and many others who simply want to live under a neutral constitution that guarantees equal rights for all. If one were to tally all those who reject sharia and demand a non-sectarian, civil state, it would be evident that we form a clear majority. The proponents of a sharia-based regime remain a minority, albeit a powerful and well-armed one.

<b>How do you explain the West’s rapid forgiveness of Joulani / Al-Charaa, despite his origins in a terrorist group once considered public enemy number one?</b>

Joulani once lived in caves in Iraq alongside Al-Qaeda fighters. He was trained in secrecy and later dispatched to Syria by Al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) to establish a local affiliate. He and his men are criminals who have murdered Syrians of all religious affiliations—without distinction.

When he officially severed ties with Al-Qaeda in 2016 and rebranded his group, it was not due to any sincere ideological shift, but out of sheer opportunism. It was a strategic move to render himself more acceptable in the eyes of the international community. His core objective has never changed: to hold on to power.

It is nothing short of outrageous that certain states have chosen to overlook his criminal past simply because he has succeeded in imposing a degree of control. If a drug cartel leader were to rise to power, would we then excuse his crimes on the grounds that he brought a semblance of “stability”? This logic is not only dangerous, but morally indefensible.

<b>Do you have evidence or testimonies from opponents or members of ethno-religious minorities who have been persecuted, oppressed, or massacred by groups from HTS or the Syrian National Army (SNA)—the two coalitions that overthrew Bashar al-Assad?</b>

Yes. While I was recently in Damascus, I personally witnessed radical preachers entering Christian neighbourhoods, denouncing residents as infidels and urging them to convert to Islam. When young Christians intervened to stop them from putting up posters instructing women how to dress, members of HTS arrested them. We later learned that this crackdown had been coordinated with the Ministry of Islamic Affairs. Incidents like this are not isolated—they have occurred repeatedly in Christian areas across the country.

As for the Alawites, massacres have taken place in several villages across Homs, Hama, and other Alawite-majority regions. Civilians have been killed—among them, recently, a pregnant woman and her husband. Reports have also documented summary executions of former regime soldiers in areas under HTS control—with at least 35 people executed over just three days, most of them Alawites. Only two days ago in Aleppo, armed men entered a flat and arrested transgender and homosexual individuals. They filmed themselves beating, humiliating, and threatening to mutilate them. As of now, we still do not know what has become of these victims.

In addition, contacts in Syria informed me that they had received direct threats warning them not to meet with religious leaders from other communities.

I can personally attest to the pressure these groups exert. I myself was threatened—albeit indirectly. Just a few days ago, during my stay in Syria, someone contacted my husband, Fabien Baussart, in an attempt to dissuade him from arranging meetings with religious leaders and other influential figures. The interference didn’t end there. I had been invited to appear in a live interview on a Syrian television channel, broadcast from Damascus. I later learnt that HTS members demanded the interview be cancelled. When the channel refused, they retaliated by threatening to have the station’s provider expelled. Under this intense pressure, the network eventually reached a compromise: my interview would not be rebroadcast or posted online. It took me two full days to retrieve the censored recording.

This experience perfectly illustrates the strategy of intimidation and media control these groups enforce to silence dissident or independent voices.

<b>Why are Western media outlets and American and European leaders not speaking out about this?</b>

The Biden administration, which has maintained back-channel communications with Joulani for at least two and a half years, appears reluctant to sever this line of contact. I do not believe the current U.S. administration is actively seeking to whitewash a terrorist—but some European leaders, perhaps out of exhaustion, expediency, or opportunism, seem willing to do just that.

Fearing a power vacuum in Syria, they have ended up aligning themselves with individuals they once considered their most dangerous enemies. Tragically, these same leaders—struggling with domestic political turmoil and facing a decline in global influence—cling to the illusion that they still hold sway in the Middle East.

<b>What is the situation of the Alawite community? Are they preparing, like the Kurds in the East or the Druze in the South, to resist? Do they have weapons? And who will protect them—Russia, the United States, or Iran?</b>

There are several trends within the Alawite community. Some advocate for a federal state, much like other groups across Syria, while others remain silent out of fear of retaliation. The main problem is the lack of structured leadership. Hafez and Bashar al-Assad systematically eliminated any Alawite figures who might have emerged as independent political leaders, leaving behind only coerced loyalty to the regime.

In terms of security, the Alawites have not surrendered all their weapons. While some arms have been handed over, a significant portion remains hidden—reserved in case their survival is threatened. But their real challenge lies not in possession of weapons, but in forming a structured, inclusive civil movement. An alliance with other communities along the coast could allow them to push for a neutral constitution, genuine power-sharing, and the decentralisation of Syria—demands that have been echoed throughout the country. This is the only viable path towards a more stable and secure future.

<b>What about the Trump administration? What are the positions of the new American president, Donald Trump, and his advisers regarding the new Syrian regime and the small American base of 900 troops currently supporting the Kurds?</b>

The Trump administration has consistently reiterated its desire to withdraw U.S. forces from Syria. However, the official figure of 900 troops is outdated—the actual number has risen to around 2,000 under Biden. Their continued presence is strategically significant.

Although Donald Trump has expressed an intention to bring these troops home, many in his circle recognise the dangers of a premature withdrawal, especially given the persistence of Islamic State cells within Syria. Such a move could open the door to a resurgence of jihadist forces, particularly if disillusioned HTS fighters—discontented with Al-Charaa’s temporary compromises—choose to defect and join Daesh. So, while Trump may wish to reduce American involvement, a hasty or poorly executed withdrawal could prove catastrophic, both for regional stability and for U.S. counterterrorism objectives.

<b>How will the Kurdish-led forces in the East defend themselves against Turkish ambitions, the Turkish-backed SNA, and even Joulani’s HTS, which seeks to subjugate Rojava and block any federal solution such as the one you advocate?</b>

The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF)—a coalition of Kurdish and Arab fighters controlling nearly a quarter of Syria’s territory in the north-east—have no choice but to fight for their survival. This is not a matter of political calculation; it is an existential imperative.

Any conflict of this kind could plunge Syria into deeper chaos and risk igniting multiple, simultaneous battlefronts. For the time being, Al-Joulani is avoiding direct confrontation with the SDF—not out of ideological restraint, but purely out of strategic caution. He knows that a large-scale military offensive would likely destroy everything he has spent years constructing.

At present, he lacks both the manpower and the weaponry needed for such an offensive. His short-term objective is not war—it is international recognition, which he hopes will consolidate his grip on power.

<b>What about the Islamic Republic of Iran? Could it return to Syria through the Alawite corridor or via the Kurdish-held east?</b>

Iran has not played its final card in Syria. I do not believe, even for a moment, that it is prepared to relinquish its influence in the region. Its immediate focus appears to be on consolidating control in Iraq—particularly through the installation of a prime minister aligned with Iranian interests. There is a genuine risk that Iran will either support or establish new militias to strengthen factions opposed to the current Syrian regime. Should the Americans withdraw, the Kurds would be forced to seek alternative protection—reshaping alliances and further fuelling regional tensions.

<b>Do you believe Joulani can maintain his grip on power and subdue both internal and external enemies without being killed—either by ex-jihadists who see him as too moderate, or by less radical Sunnis who find him too extreme?</b>

I do not believe, under any circumstances, that Joulani can entrench his power or impose his ideological vision in the long term. If he were truly as astute as some claim, he would not have prematurely declared himself president of Syria. A more strategic move would have been to collaborate with other opposition figures close to Qatar and Turkey, thereby creating the illusion of political plurality and legitimacy.

Moreover, he does not command full control over his ranks—particularly the most radical elements and foreign fighters. His lack of authority became glaringly evident when he promoted a Uyghur jihadist within his military structure, without anticipating the diplomatic backlash from China. These Uyghur fighters, who arrived in Syria through international jihadist networks, have clearly expressed their intent to return to China to wage war against the Beijing regime. That incident alone exposed Joulani’s political inexperience and his lack of understanding of global power dynamics. He is now surrounded by enemies—within his own movement and across the broader region. His future remains precarious: he could very well be eliminated by his own men or by rival factions that detest him, each for their own reasons.

<b>What about the forces of Ahmad al-Awdeh, head of the Southern Brigades—also known as the “Southern Operations Room”—who arrived in Damascus 11 hours before HTS in early December 2024 to bring down Bashar al-Assad? With nearly 8,000 fighters, could this force eventually clash with Joulani’s troops or even ally with other southern groups like the Druze?</b>

To date, Ahmad al-Awdeh’s Southern Brigades have not entered into negotiations with Joulani, and the province of Daraa remains under the de facto control of armed local clans, who continue to operate autonomously. This poses a serious problem for Joulani, as his leadership—though physically established in Damascus—does not extend to the South, nor to Suwayda, the Druze heartland, or the north-east, which remains under Kurdish control.

There is also the possibility of a new battlefront emerging along the western coastline. It should not be forgotten that Joulani does not even have full control over northern Syria. Significant portions of the region—including parts of Aleppo—remain under the influence of Turkish-backed Islamist and Arab-Turkmen groups, aligned with the Syrian National Army (SNA), formerly the Free Syrian Army (FSA). Their primary objective is to defeat the Kurds in the East and create a pro-Turkish buffer zone along the northern border.

As for a possible confrontation between Ahmad al-Awdeh’s Southern Brigades and Joulani’s HTS, that remains a very real scenario—especially if the local balance of power shifts, and southern forces, including the Druze, decide to unite in resistance to Joulani’s territorial ambitions.

<b>A timely question that extends beyond Syria: what do you think of the “Kellogg Plan” for Ukraine, which Donald Trump’s special envoy is expected to present at the Munich Security Conference?</b>

From what I understand, the Kellogg Plan seeks to freeze the conflict by allowing Russia to retain control of the occupied territories, while guaranteeing Ukraine’s non-accession to NATO. In return, the security of the rest of Ukrainian territory would be formally protected. This proposal appears acceptable to Russia, whose red line has always been to prevent Ukraine from joining NATO.

That said, we shall have to wait and see whether other elements of the plan are open to negotiation. However, it seems unlikely that Russia would willingly return all the territories it has seized since 2014. The plan’s effectiveness depends on whether it offers each party enough to claim a form of victory, or at least a dignified compromise.

<b>There is growing talk about U.S.–Iran negotiations, and also about Donald Trump’s proposal to transform Gaza into a prosperous “Riviera” after transferring its population to Egypt and Jordan. Beyond Trump’s theatrics and “deal-making” persona, how do you assess these negotiations from a concrete geopolitical standpoint?</b>

As for Trump’s “Gaza plan”, I find it absurd. Such a proposal would only inflame tensions with neighbouring countries—particularly Egypt and Jordan—who would be forcibly implicated in this fantastical vision of mass population transfer. But we also know that Trump is capable of changing his mind twice a day, so we must take such declarations with caution.

Regarding Iran, Trump is now negotiating over the nuclear file—a striking turn of events given that he himself withdrew from the original JCPOA during his first term. Today, he appears to be seeking a compromise, aware that Iran may be just weeks away from acquiring four to five nuclear warheads, according to some estimates. At that point, even a pre-emptive strike would lose its strategic effectiveness.

In that light, it is entirely plausible that Trump might backtrack on Gaza—not out of empathy, but because reaching a nuclear agreement with Iran takes precedence. Such a deal would have far greater implications for regional and global stability.
