**A new round of dialogue in Astana** _Al Mayadeen TV_ 2 October 2015

**Summary:**

A new round of negotiations between representatives of the Syrian opposition has commenced in the Kazakh capital, Astana, following a previous session held in May. The objective remains unchanged: to reach a political settlement to the protracted conflict in Syria. Convened behind closed doors and scheduled to continue until Sunday, the talks bring together 37 Syrian figures from a diverse range of national, Islamic, and Kurdish backgrounds, most of whom advocate political dialogue as the sole viable path forward.

Kazakhstan is hosting the meetings in keeping with its neutral diplomatic stance, reaffirming its support for a political resolution that safeguards Syria’s territorial integrity. Some members of the delegation have voiced support for enhanced local governance arrangements, resembling a federalist model. The Kazakh Foreign Ministry has emphasised that the initiative is driven by humanitarian concern and a commitment to facilitating a solution acceptable to key regional stakeholders, including Russia and Iran.

The negotiations are being conducted under the framework of the Astana Platform, an initiative established by Syrian political figure Randa Kassis, whose longstanding efforts have centred on fostering inclusive dialogue and promoting negotiated solutions to the crisis. This latest round highlights the importance of achieving consensus among all components of Syrian society in order to lay the foundations for a democratic and pluralistic state—one that guarantees individual rights and protects against authoritarianism.

A final communiqué outlining the principal points of agreement and the overall trajectory of the discussions is expected at the conclusion of this round.
