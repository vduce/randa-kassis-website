Guests: Bassam al-Malek & Randa Kassis

<b>Summary:</b>

The Geneva III negotiations, convened to address the Syrian conflict, commenced amid marked contrasts. The opposition prioritised humanitarian concerns and sought to gauge the regime’s intentions, while the latter accused its adversaries of lacking seriousness. UN Special Envoy Staffan de Mistura expressed cautious optimism, although the talks began under considerable strain due to international pressures, conflicting interests, and fundamentally divergent visions of a resolution.

The early stages of the proceedings laid bare the deep divisions within the opposition. Randa Kassis, representing the Secular Democratic Delegation, contended that negotiations had not genuinely begun, as her delegation had been excluded. She rejected the characterisation of her group as mere “consultants”, stressing that they had received formal invitations as negotiating parties. Kassis advocated a secular and pluralistic vision for Syria, calling for constitutional reform and a gradual political transition, while maintaining a firm stance against the Assad regime.

By contrast, Bassam al-Malek of the Syrian National Coalition called for the formation of a transitional governing body—rather than a unity government—citing UN Security Council Resolution 2254. He underscored the need for a unified opposition stance and voiced reservations about including figures perceived as sympathetic to the regime, unless they explicitly endorsed the principles of the Riyadh platform.

A fundamental rift emerged concerning the legitimate representation of the Syrian opposition. Kassis advanced a position grounded in political realism and inclusivity, whereas al-Malek insisted upon strict adherence to shared objectives. Both recognised the necessity of international pressure—particularly from Russia—in compelling the regime to make concessions. Yet while al-Malek condemned Russian and Iranian involvement as exacerbating the conflict, Kassis retained a cautious hope in Russia’s potential role, viewing incremental change as the only viable path forward.

The exchange concluded with al-Malek warning of the risk of collapse should the regime persist in obstruction and military escalation. Kassis, meanwhile, urged opposition factions to rise above personal egos and unite in pursuit of a democratic, pluralistic Syria through step-by-step reform.
