With Alexandre del Valle

The Turkish army has launched a military operation in northern Syria targeting Kurdish forces. Alexandre del Valle examines the consequences of this abandonment in a conversation with Randa Kassis, a moderate and secular opponent of the Syrian regime.

Following the earlier betrayal of the Kurds in Afrin and western Syria—where the Turkish military and pro-Ankara Islamist militias have since perpetrated massacres and displaced Kurdish communities west of the Euphrates—this time it is the Kurds of eastern Syria who have been forsaken. The decision was made on Sunday evening by US President Donald Trump, who reached an understanding with Turkey’s neo-Sultan, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, during a telephone call. Del Valle considers this act of treachery—rightly denounced by numerous moral and political voices in the West—as a foreseeable and almost inevitable outcome of cynical realpolitik and the sacrosanct nature of international borders.

To explore the wider implications of this abandonment, Del Valle spoke with Randa Kassis, President of the Astana Platform and a secular, moderate figure within the Syrian opposition. Kassis champions a vision for a pluralistic and democratic Syria, one that transcends both Assad’s dictatorship and Islamist extremism. Her vision entails safeguarding the cultural and religious rights of Sunnis, Shiites, Christians (including Arameans, Armenians, and Arabs), Alawites, Druze, and Kurds alike, within a federal framework. Such a vision is detested both by the centralised Syrian regime and by Ankara, which remains staunchly anti-Kurdish and labels the PKK and its Syrian affiliates—the YPG and the SDF—as ‘terrorists’.

The Turkish Armed Forces, in conjunction with the Syrian National Army (SNA—a coalition of Turkish-backed Syrian rebels), launched “Operation Peace Spring” against Kurdish positions in northern Syria. In preparation for the offensive, Western allied forces—American, French, and British—withdrew from key areas, effectively granting Ankara free rein. This retreat constitutes a shameful, though sadly predictable, betrayal of the Kurds and their allies.

But who still believes in the loyalty or reliability of Western powers? These are the very same powers that, under the 1920 Treaty of Sèvres, pledged to establish both a Kurdish and an Armenian state—promises swiftly abandoned in the face of Atatürk’s determination, even as 1.5 million Armenians and countless Syriac-Aramean Christians were exterminated by his Young Turk predecessors, alongside the ethnic cleansing of the Pontic Greeks.

By Wednesday afternoon, Turkish artillery and air strikes were already pounding border towns—Tal Abyad, Ras al-Ayn, Qamishli, Ain Issa, and Kobani—causing thousands of Kurds to flee. At least fifteen people, including eight civilians, had been killed by that point. It is worth recalling that the Syrian Kurdish forces (YPG/YPJ) and the broader SDF coalition—comprising both Arab

and Kurdish fighters—had been among the most dependable allies of the United States, France, and Britain since 2015, leading a heroic campaign against ISIS and other jihadist groups (including Al-Nusra, Al-Qaeda, and HTS). Yet Turkey’s geopolitical importance as a NATO member situated at the crossroads of Europe and Asia has compelled even President Trump to yield to Ankara.

It is no secret that Erdogan’s nationalist-Islamist regime has consistently regarded Kurdish separatists—not jihadists—as its principal adversaries. In both Turkey and Syria, Kurdish communities have endured sustained persecution and military aggression. The YPG’s historical links to the PKK, whose leader Abdullah Öcalan remains imprisoned in Turkey, only intensify Ankara’s hostility.

From Ankara’s standpoint, this unwavering focus on combating Kurdish ‘terrorists’ in Rojava—the de facto autonomous Kurdish region in northern Syria—demonstrates a coherent strategic objective. Erdogan has shown a readiness to forge tactical alliances with unlikely partners—including Russia, Iran, certain Iraqi Kurdish factions, and even the Assad regime—provided that the Kurds are excluded. In forums such as Sochi, Astana, Istanbul, and Tehran, Turkey has aligned with Assad’s backers so long as Kurdish aspirations are curbed. Meanwhile, Erdogan continues to exploit his leverage over the West, threatening to pivot towards Moscow and Beijing should Western powers fail to acquiesce to Turkish demands.

Although Trump had already promised Erdogan in 2018 that Turkey could establish a 32-kilometre-deep ‘safe zone’ along the Syrian border, elements within the American defence establishment remained hesitant to completely abandon the Kurds. In retaliation, Erdogan proceeded with the purchase of Russian S-400 missile defence systems, exacerbating tensions with NATO. In the end, it was Erdogan—not Trump—who prevailed in the negotiations, compelling the US President to withdraw support from the Kurdish cause. Despite Western rhetoric, the defeat of ISIS owes far more to the sacrifices of Kurdish fighters: 11,000 killed, 25,000 wounded, and over 1,000 left permanently disabled, according to YPG-YPJ estimates.

<b>Ms Randa Kassis, as someone deeply involved in Syrian political affairs, what is your reaction to President Trump’s recent announcement of a US military withdrawal from northern Syria? Would you describe it as abandonment?</b>

The United States’ abrupt decision to withdraw from northeastern Syria represents, in itself, a grave strategic miscalculation—both morally and geopolitically. It will ultimately prove counterproductive to any future efforts aimed at achieving peace in Syria. Erdogan’s fixation on establishing a so-called 'safe corridor' will only exacerbate internal strife and benefit ISIS, which is already anticipating the release of its detainees currently held by the SDF/YPG.

<b>Has President Trump retreated slightly under pressure from within his own Republican camp? He did warn that the Turkish economy would be 'destroyed' if Erdogan attacked the Kurds, and it appears not all American troops are withdrawing.</b>

President Trump’s stance shifts almost daily. His response to Turkey’s offensive has been disjointed—initially threatening to destroy the Turkish economy, only to adopt a more subdued tone once the operation commenced. He recently stated, 'It’s a bad idea; the Turks must avoid a humanitarian crisis'. His reactions are erratic and lack coherence.

<b>In your view, how does this amount to a moral failure on the part of the United States? Is there any room for morality in international relations or geopolitics?</b>

To abandon a region of Syria to Turkish aggression—fully aware of Ankara’s intent to carry out demographic engineering—is disgraceful. While Ankara has never hidden its animosity towards the Kurds and has made no promises to them, the United States and its Western allies are violating their own stated principles and strategic commitments by effectively aligning themselves with Turkey’s military campaign. The Kurds and Syriac-Arameans are not outsiders—they are indigenous peoples who have lived in this region for millennia. This betrayal not only endangers their lives but also increases the likelihood of an ISIS resurgence—especially considering Erdogan’s regime has previously facilitated ISIS’s movements. Moreover, with over 2,000 Western jihadists detained by the Kurds, the repercussions of this abandonment may soon return to haunt Europe.

<b>What is your response to Trump’s assertion that the Turkish army will take over responsibility for the jihadist prisoners currently held by Kurdish forces?</b>

It is naïve—if not outright reckless—to believe that Erdogan’s Islamist regime can responsibly manage approximately 118,000 jihadist detainees and their families. These individuals will become political bargaining chips in Erdogan’s hands, used to pressure Western governments or destabilise vulnerable minorities in the region. Erdogan’s neo-Ottoman ambitions are already evident in Turkish-controlled areas of Syria, where Islamist institutions are being established. These jihadist elements will simply continue the 'dirty work' begun by the Turkish military—namely, the systematic eradication of the Kurds.

<b>At least twenty Kurdish fighters have been killed, and thousands of civilians displaced. The Turkish army appears to be targeting not only militias but civilian areas as well. How long can Kurdish resistance hold out? Can ethnic cleansing be prevented?</b>

I fear the conflict will persist. History teaches us that foreign military interventions almost always lead to humanitarian disasters. President Trump should have weighed the consequences of his decision far more carefully before authorising this offensive.

<b>How do you view Erdogan’s justification, using the 'political process' and 'fight against terrorism', to legitimise his actions?</b>

The so-called Constitutional Committee promoted by the three guarantor states is nothing more than a façade. Turkey is using it as a pretext to occupy Syrian territory and carry out demographic replacement—displacing Kurds and installing Sunni Arab populations and Islamist militias loyal to Ankara. The establishment of religious institutions in areas under Turkish control clearly reveals Erdogan’s true aim: the restoration of a caliphate under his leadership. Meanwhile, the UN’s enthusiasm over the Committee’s formation is, quite frankly, laughable.

<b>Turning to the United Nations, do you believe Special Envoy Geir Pedersen is making any progress by promoting the Committee as a means towards a broader political solution?</b>

For over a year, Mr Pedersen has limited his outreach to regime-sanctioned opposition figures, many of whom are closely aligned with Turkey. This approach reflects either troubling naïvety or a deliberate sidelining of credible alternatives. A genuine political resolution must include all currents within the opposition—not merely the Sunni Islamist factions backed by Turkey and Saudi Arabia. The Committee as it stands today consists largely of individuals paid by these foreign powers, with only a handful of independent voices remaining. UN Secretary-General António Guterres’s role in this process typifies the organisation’s impotence—unable to resolve long-standing crises in Cyprus, Libya, Syria, or Kashmir. As for Mr Pedersen, the real question is: what meaningful outcome can be expected from a political process built on the illusion of trust between a murderous regime and an opposition hollowed out by foreign agendas? Ironically, the Committee was announced just days before Turkey launched its so-called 'Operation Spring of Peace'—a grotesque euphemism for a campaign of death and displacement. The Kurds now face the risk of ethnic cleansing, to be replaced by Sunni Arabs affiliated with Ankara. Meanwhile, Erdogan’s Islamist proxies stand ready to take the place of the SDF and YPG across the region.

<b>How do you respond to Erdogan’s argument that 3.5 million Syrian refugees currently in Turkey must return, and that 'buffer forces' should be deployed across the 'safe zone'?</b>

It is delusional to imagine that 3.5 million people will return voluntarily. There are credible concerns that Turkey will forcibly repatriate these refugees and use them as human shields. This operation should not be called 'Spring of Peace'—it is, in reality, a 'Spring of Chaos'. Granting Turkey carte blanche in such a volatile context is not merely irresponsible—it is outright madness.
