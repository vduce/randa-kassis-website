<h4>Only Moscow Still Appears Capable of Imposing Change in Syria</h4>

On 25 May, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov held discussions with members of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), and on that occasion welcomed the constructive dialogue with his counterparts. For his part, Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir reaffirmed Riyadh’s desire to strengthen ties with Moscow. In a context where the diplomatic process is at a standstill, a shift in the Saudi position and a temporary alignment with Moscow could pave the way for a new Russian initiative as an alternative to the Geneva process. Randa Kassis, representative of the secular Syrian opposition, reflects in this interview on Moscow’s central role in breaking the deadlock in the negotiations.

<b>The Geneva process is currently moribund, and it is highly likely that the deadline for the resumption of talks will not be met. Is there an alternative process beginning to take shape?</b>

There remains no clear alternative to Geneva. The process is at an impasse, largely due to the stance of certain regional actors who reject a constructive approach, and the inconsistency of the Riyadh delegation which, while formally participating in Geneva, refuses to remove the obstacles to dialogue. This deadlock most clearly illustrates the United States’ declining influence over its regional allies. Washington is no longer able to impose its terms on its Saudi and Turkish partners. President Barack Obama’s attempt to reach an understanding with Moscow to initiate a genuine political process was undermined by internal contradictions in the American administration’s handling of the crisis. Only Moscow still appears capable of imposing a gradual yet far-reaching shift in this matter.

<b>What is the current state of US-Russian relations following the breakdown of the agreement between Moscow and Washington for a political solution to the Syrian crisis?</b>

When Barack Obama decided to engage with the Syrian dossier, with the genuine intention of separating it from the Ukrainian conflict and the nuclear issue, it was the State Department that opposed any agreement with Russia. Part of the US administration remains aligned with the hard-line positions of Ankara and Riyadh, adhering to a strategy of attrition. While negotiation is accepted in principle, a series of preconditions continues to be imposed. The Americans still seem to misunderstand Russia’s operating methods and political culture. The overall US approach towards Russia remains aggressive, despite the willingness of some within the administration to resolve the impasse through incremental steps. In the Syrian context, Washington supports the economic sanctions imposed on Moscow on 29 July 2014, which have been regularly extended since. Yet it is the European Union that bears the brunt of this crisis, as Russia has retaliated with countermeasures, including an embargo on a wide range of European agri-food products.

<b>Do the Russians currently have the capacity to break the deadlock without active US support?</b>

Yes, because Russia undeniably holds a position of strength. Operationally, it has reinforced its presence in Syria and remains the only actor capable of exerting effective pressure on the Syrian regime to propose reforms that may offer a path out of the crisis. Moscow could pursue a solution through the United Nations, particularly if the Europeans align with Russia’s position to break the stalemate. The United States is playing a double game and can no longer rely on its traditional allies. It is now evident that a convergence between Moscow and Riyadh is entirely plausible.

<b>Indeed, the meeting between Mikhail Bogdanov and his GCC counterparts suggests a rapprochement between Riyadh and Moscow. Could an agreement on Syria be reached in the coming months?</b>

Yes, the fundamental differences between Moscow and Riyadh do not preclude a rapprochement in the coming weeks, which could prove decisive in reaching a political solution to the crisis. It is worth recalling that, for Riyadh, the issue is above all personal: the Saudis remain inflexible regarding the unconditional departure of Bashar al-Assad. They also harbour deep concerns about Tehran’s policies and its growing regional influence. However, the Russian intervention in Syria has, to some extent, also worked against Iran’s interests, and the contradictions between Moscow and Tehran are real. Nevertheless, Russia is capable of tempering tensions between the two and striking a balance between Iranian and Saudi regional ambitions. If Moscow can provide sufficient guarantees to Riyadh, a shift in the situation is entirely possible. The principal adversary remains Turkey and President Erdoğan’s neo-Ottoman expansionism.
