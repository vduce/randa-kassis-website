**Constitutional Reform Is a Cruel Joke: From De Mistura’s Dance to Pedersen’s Stagnation** _Al-Sabah Newspaper_ 8 June 2019 By Sarah Ramadan

Randa Kassis, President of the Astana Committee for the Syrian Opposition, has stated that the current situation is indeed bleak. Nonetheless, she remains convinced that change in Syria is still possible. Her vision extends beyond political measures to encompass social and cultural transformation.

Despite the ongoing tragedy wrought by the war, Kassis, who heads the Astana Platform for the Syrian Opposition, believes that persistent and serious efforts to launch a new political process—however varied in form—will eventually pave the way to overcoming the Syrian crisis. She also emphasises that such a process cannot succeed without the constructive involvement of Arab states, foremost among them Egypt. We spoke to her in the following interview:

**Why insist on constitutional reform in Syria? Do you see it as the root of the crisis?**

There is no doubt that reforming the current Syrian constitution is a crucial step which could lay the groundwork for a new phase and trigger a political process. Guided by this belief, the Astana political platform began organising a series of meetings in November 2017. We invited Syrian political, legal, and constitutional opposition figures, as well as former foreign ministers—Yashar Yakis from Turkey and Giulio Terzi from Italy. We also consulted several French constitutional experts.

Together, we drafted a proposal for constitutional amendments. There must now be a concerted effort to pressure international powers into supporting the creation of a genuinely effective constitutional committee—one capable of implementing real reform. These reforms should include limiting presidential powers and ensuring that credible elections are held before 2021.

**What are your current efforts, given the ongoing Geneva talks and the National Dialogue in Sochi?**

Within our platform, we concluded that the Geneva negotiations between the official delegation and the Riyadh-based opposition were sterile. In 2017, we succeeded in producing a balanced constitutional draft which, alongside other Syrian political actors, could contribute to amending the current constitution via a Syrian constitutional committee.

As you know, the Syrian National Dialogue Congress in Sochi concluded on 30 January 2018 with a final communiqué, the most significant outcome of which was the agreement to establish a constitutional committee. That objective guided our work throughout 2017, despite fierce resistance from many within the opposition and members of the regime’s delegation.

**In your view, what are the reasons behind the failure to form that committee?**

Regrettably, the outcomes of the Sochi conference—particularly the formation of a constitutional committee—were distorted by Mr De Mistura. We witnessed a striking failure in the attempt to establish that body.

**Has that approach changed following the appointment of a new UN envoy?**

Initially, I was personally optimistic about the appointment of a new envoy. I hoped that a change in leadership would signal a break from Mr De Mistura’s failed approach and flawed formula for forming the committee. However, unfortunately, Mr Pedersen has thus far demonstrated no competence. I am now convinced that we have merely moved from De Mistura’s “dance” to Pedersen’s endless circling. That is where matters now stand.

**What, in your view, is the solution?**

I remain convinced that unless we fully dismantle the legacy of De Mistura’s process and adopt an entirely new approach, there will be no solution in Syria. Sanctions will persist, and Syria will continue down the path once trodden by Iraq in the 1990s.

**How optimistic are you about resolving the Syrian crisis?**

Despite the darkness of the current moment, I am fully persuaded that we will succeed in effecting change in Syria—not only in political terms, but also at the social and cultural levels. This conviction stems from sustained effort and constant reflection on new initiatives that might help realise the aspirations of many Syrians.

**Why have you not enlisted Arab countries to help resolve the crisis?**

We absolutely require the engagement of certain Arab states, especially Egypt, which could make a valuable contribution to this initiative—alongside other countries that have not been directly involved in the Syrian conflict. Our hand remains extended to all those willing to take part, for our objective is none other than the Syrian people.
