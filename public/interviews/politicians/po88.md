**The Red Line** _France 5 – C Dans l’air_ 23 August 2013 Guests: Frédéric Encel, Jean Dominique Merchet, Randa Kassis & Robert Solé

**Summary:**

The episode of C dans l’air aired on 23 August 2013 examined the suspected use of chemical weapons by the Syrian regime in Ghouta, near Damascus. The programme brought together specialists in geopolitics, military strategy, and Middle Eastern affairs to assess the credibility of the allegations and the broader implications for Syria and the international community.

Most panellists agreed that the video evidence and observed symptoms strongly indicated the use of a chemical agent, most likely sarin gas. However, views diverged on the matter of culpability. Some argued that Bashar al-Assad had both the means and the strategic interest to carry out such an attack, even in the presence of United Nations inspectors stationed nearby. Others, by contrast, raised the possibility of a provocation orchestrated by rebel factions, potentially aimed at compelling Western military intervention.

The discussion also examined the international deadlock—particularly the inability of the UN Security Council to take decisive action, owing to persistent Russian and Chinese vetoes. The crisis was situated within the wider context of Middle Eastern instability, marked by two overlapping conflicts: the Sunni–Shia divide and the ideological battle between secularists and Islamists. Concerns were voiced over regional spillover, particularly into Lebanon, as well as the erosion of state structures across the Levant.

The programme concluded with a consensus that Western intervention appeared increasingly unlikely, as public opinion, political caution, and geopolitical complexities weighed against any decisive action. The conversation left viewers with a sobering sense of the broader consequences of inaction—not only for Syria, but for the credibility of international norms against weapons of mass destruction.

Randa Kassis, a Syrian anthropologist and political figure, contributed a particularly measured and critical perspective. While not excluding the possibility of regime responsibility, she questioned the logic of such an act at a time when Assad’s forces were gaining ground and with UN inspectors already present in Damascus. She called for restraint and insisted that blame should not be assigned prior to the conclusion of a full and unrestricted investigation by UN experts.

Kassis also raised the troubling possibility of a fabricated incident intended to provoke international intervention. Politically, she reiterated her longstanding call for a decentralised solution to Syria’s crisis—arguing that the notion of a unified national identity had collapsed and that trust between communities had been irreparably damaged. In her view, reconciliation through a centralised state is no longer feasible. Only a federal framework with strong guarantees for minority rights offers a viable foundation for long-term stability.
