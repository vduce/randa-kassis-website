<h4>Al-Joulani Endorsed by Macron and Trump: “A Deeply Irresponsible Act”</h4>

Randa Kassis, a Franco-Syrian anthropologist, politician, and writer, and president of the Movement for a Pluralistic Society, is a leading figure in the opposition—initially to the former Ba’athist regime of Bashar al-Assad, and now to that of Ahmed al-Charaa, also known as Abu Mohammed al-Joulani, the head of the so-called “moderate butchers” of HTS, who has just been endorsed by Presidents Macron and Trump.

Having visited the Alawite, Druze, and Christian minorities, and returned to Damascus after years in exile, Randa Kassis expresses no greater confidence in the new regime than she once had in Assad’s government. In this exclusive interview, she offers her perspective on the nature of this allegedly “moderate” Islamist authority. She also reflects on the naivety of Western powers who believe they can tame or moderate jihadists—jihadists who have barbarically targeted minorities since their seizure of Damascus.

**Ahmed al-Charaa, aka al-Joulani—the self-proclaimed Syrian president and former right-hand man of al-Baghdadi, the ex-caliph of Daesh—was welcomed with great fanfare in Paris by Emmanuel Macron, despite the fact that US intelligence had just confirmed that Joulani had distributed passports to hundreds of international jihadists since his arrival in Damascus. A few days later, he was explicitly endorsed by Donald Trump in Riyadh, in the presence of Saudi Arabia’s strongman, MBS. What is your reaction to this?**

It is a deeply irresponsible act on the part of both Emmanuel Macron and Donald Trump. Let us begin with the French president: inviting to Paris a man who once served as al-Baghdadi’s right-hand and now proclaims himself Syria’s leader amounts to granting a degree of legitimacy to a regime born of a murderous jihadist current. It is tantamount to implicitly approving all the massacres committed by this regime—not only against Syrians, but also against French victims of terrorism. Let us not forget that Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, led by al-Joulani, publicly praised the 2015 Paris attacks, lamenting only that his own group had not carried them out against the kuffar.

Moreover, the terrorist who beheaded Samuel Paty had links to members of HTS—an organisation founded and led from the outset by al-Joulani. Now, US intelligence confirms he is issuing passports to hundreds of foreign jihadists since establishing himself in Damascus. In this context, receiving him in Paris is not a diplomatic gesture—it is a betrayal of the fundamental principles of any democracy.

As for Donald Trump, what truly shocks me is the ease with which some Western leaders welcome a figure like al-Joulani, deliberately ignoring his involvement in attacks that killed their own citizens—including Americans—particularly in Iraq when he was under the command of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the precursor to Daesh to which Joulani once belonged. This negligence is not only an affront to the memory of the victims; it also reveals a dangerously reckless political attitude, as though the region could still endure such irresponsible gambles.

This meeting with Trump will not change anything of substance. Syria is not currently a land of stability: insecurity persists, clashes are increasing, and any attempt at “normalisation” with figures like al-Joulani will only exacerbate tensions. What many prefer to ignore is that behind this image of a pragmatic leader, the same man remains. Even within Trump’s circle, many are unwilling to risk their credibility on such a gamble. They know full well that the legalistic rhetoric he now employs is merely a temporary façade designed to consolidate his grip on power.

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio even stated plainly: “Al-Joulani has asked us for help to eliminate foreign jihadists.” On the surface, the sentence sounds innocuous—but in reality, it risks reigniting frontlines, fuelling internal rivalries, and leaving him isolated among those who see any compromise as betrayal.

**You recently visited Syria and met with leaders of various minorities, notably the Alawites and, more formally, the Druze in their southern stronghold. What was your reaction to the massacres of at least twelve Druze between late April and early May, following the even more extensive massacres of Alawites in March?**

During my recent visit to Damascus and to Druze areas in southern Syria, I witnessed firsthand the growing tensions afflicting this community. The events between late April and early May—marked by targeted attacks—reflect both the deterioration of security and the persistent failure of the authorities to protect minorities. Simultaneously, the rise of jihadist militias and extremist actors such as Hayat Tahrir al-Sham is contributing to the further fragmentation of Syrian territory. This shift is entrenching a new form of authoritarianism, every bit as incompatible with stability and the protection of civilians as the former regimes.

The Druze, like other minorities, once again find themselves exposed to systemic violence amid widespread indifference. There is nothing to hope for from these radical Islamist groups. They uphold no commitments and present no credible political vision. Their point of reference is neither the state nor the nation, but a mythologised Ummah—entirely alien to the principles of sovereignty, rights, and citizenship.

**Should we then distrust al-Charaa/al-Joulani’s assurances to Macron and Trump that the Islamists who massacred Druze—allegedly in retaliation for a supposed Druze blasphemy against Muhammad—were not under his control, and that he bore no responsibility?**

Absolutely. Can we genuinely believe al-Joulani when he claims that the Islamists behind the recent Druze massacres—supposedly in revenge for an alleged blasphemy against the Prophet Muhammad—were not under his command? Even if this version were true, it would merely confirm the steady emergence of a dark and regressive order governed by a mediaeval mindset—one that al-Joulani and his terrorist gangs exemplify to the letter.

Yet it is far more likely that this justification was either opportunistic or entirely fabricated. All signs point to a deliberate strategy: the systematic targeting of Syria’s diverse communities in order to subjugate, crush, or drive them into exile.

**More broadly, is it true that massacres of Druze, Christians, and especially Alawites have become frequent since January 2025? And is it also true that the media have only reported the tip of the iceberg—concealing numerous other cases carried out daily by the so-called “moderate butchers” of HTS and even the CNS?**

Since January 2025, violence against minorities in Syria—particularly Alawites, Druze, and to a lesser extent Christians—has increased significantly. Many crimes go unreported due to the control exercised by armed groups and the lack of access for independent journalists.

According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, over 1,800 civilians—mostly Alawites—were killed between January and March 2025 in the governorates of Latakia, Tartus, Hama, and Homs. Over 200 Druze have also been killed since the start of the year. Around fifty Alawite women have been abducted, reportedly for sexual exploitation—reminiscent of Daesh’s treatment of Yazidi women. Five Christian civilians were also killed during the 12 March massacres, and recent incidents—including in Maaloula—have reignited tensions within that community.

Abductions of businessmen continue indiscriminately—even Sunnis such as Hashem al-Akkad have been kidnapped by so-called security forces. This widespread targeting once again proves that this government is merely another face of Daesh—employing the same tactics: terror, subjugation, and the destruction of Syria’s social fabric. These acts are not random. They reflect a calculated strategy to weaken, silence, or expel each community—all in the service of a regime founded on brutality and ideology.

**How do you respond to those within Sunni and anti-Israeli circles who claim that the Druze massacres were orchestrated by Israeli intelligence to justify a long-term occupation of the Syrian Golan Heights, where most Druze live? Or to those who cite Israeli strikes in Druze-populated areas elsewhere in Syria?**

Blaming Israeli intelligence for orchestrating the Druze massacres to justify the occupation of the Golan—or for its airstrikes in Druze-populated areas—is a simplistic and profoundly irresponsible narrative. It insults people’s intelligence. Even al-Joulani, notorious for evading responsibility, has never made such a claim. As usual, he simply denied involvement and shifted the blame to “other jihadists.” But fundamentally, he remains at the heart of the problem.

Al-Joulani is today one of the principal destabilising forces in Syria. He poses a direct threat not only to minorities and national unity, but to regional stability as a whole. His presence effectively legitimises Israel’s continued control of the Golan—for no state would tolerate an uncontained jihadist entity on its borders.

His ideology has not changed. Public statements and softened rhetoric do not alter a person’s worldview. One does not become “moderate” simply by declaring oneself so. Real transformation—if possible at all—requires time, conditions, a new context, and genuine introspection. None of this is evident in al-Joulani’s case.

**How do you explain the West’s complicit silence — including that of the United States, which recently withdrew half its remaining forces from Syria?**

The Western silence — including that of the United States — over the current situation in Syria amounts to passive complicity. Europe, in particular, is undergoing a phase of strategic decline: no vision, no leadership, no initiative. Its foreign policy resembles improvisation — incoherent and directionless. Some leaders act merely to generate media buzz; others mimic them like children in a schoolyard. There is neither consistency nor any genuine will to understand the region’s dynamics.

As for the United States, it recently announced the withdrawal of 1,000 out of the 2,000 troops still stationed in Syria. Some of these forces are now being redeployed to bases in Iraq, near the Syrian border. Despite announcements of further withdrawals in 2025 and 2026 — notably from Iraqi and Kurdish regions — it is now clear that the timeline has been postponed indefinitely. Two strategic US bases remain fully operational. Their proximity suggests that Washington still intends to monitor Syria’s power dynamics without direct engagement. This shift coincided with the fall of the Assad regime. It is true that under Trump, Syria is no longer a priority. But it remains unlikely that the US will lift sanctions or recognise any government born from jihadist factions. For now, they observe from a distance, partially disengaged, allowing the situation to evolve — even at the expense of civilians and regional stability.

**What role are Turkey, Qatar and Saudi Arabia playing in all this?**

Turkey’s intentions are clear: to exert partial control over the new Syrian government while establishing a structured military presence in the country. Ankara’s main objective remains the neutralisation of Syrian Kurds, whom it considers its principal strategic threat. Everything else — political influence or support for specific factions — is merely a means to that end.

Qatar, for its part, seeks to maintain its regional influence and position itself as a mediator in conflicts, while discreetly continuing to fund various jihadist groups. Its approach is one of double-edged diplomacy: dialogue on one side, ideological and logistical support on the other.

Saudi Arabia, under the leadership of MBS, aspires to become the new regional architect — the sole authority capable of shaping political and financial balances. However, despite their ambitions, neither the Saudis, nor Qatar, nor Turkey are willing to shoulder the real costs of Syria’s reconstruction. Take Qatar, for example: with American approval, Doha is preparing to disburse $28 million to help cover certain state expenses, particularly public sector salaries. This remains purely symbolic — a drop in the ocean compared to the vast needs on the ground. None of these states intends to rebuild what they themselves helped to fragment.

**How do the Iranians plan to reassert their presence in Syria, especially since the Kurds signed an agreement with Damascus?**

That agreement is already void. It has led to no concrete implementation, and none of its provisions has been honoured. Al-Joulani simply ignored its existence, issuing a unilateral constitutional declaration with no regard for the agreement or for Syria’s ethnic, religious, and political diversity. That text unequivocally reveals a determination to Islamise the country — in total opposition to any pluralist or national vision.

In this context, Iran does not seek to reassert itself in Syria through overt or centralised means, but rather via a network of affiliated groups. It still possesses numerous local levers — militias, ideologically aligned units, and economic agents — which allow it to maintain covert influence. Tehran is likely to capitalise on the strategic vacuum left by Western disengagement, as well as on internal rivalries between Sunni actors, to reactivate its networks and incrementally redeploy its influence.

**What future is there for the “inclusive Syria” that Charaa/al-Joulani claims he will enshrine in the upcoming constitution?**

The idea of an “inclusive Syria”, as claimed by al-Joulani in his proposed constitution, is nothing more than a political illusion. In reality, it will be a façade government — filled with puppets and token figures designed to create the appearance of pluralism. The objective is clear: to gradually facilitate normalisation with certain Western states, while retaining absolute control over the levers of power.

He has already secured endorsements from Macron and Trump. But despite his promises of future democracy and inclusion, al-Joulani retains — and will continue to retain — all sovereign ministries: Defence, Interior, Justice. The majority of his government members are closely linked to Hayat Tahrir al-Sham. This so-called civil power is nothing more than the political extension of jihadist structures.

The recent appointment of Ahmad al-Hayes — alias Hatem Abu Shaqra — as commander of the Syrian Army’s 86th division illustrates this perfectly. A former leader of Ahrar al-Sharqiya, he was responsible for the brutal assassination of Kurdish politician Hevrin Khalaf in 2019. Ahrar al-Sharqiya incorporated numerous former Daesh members and was accused of serious crimes including abductions, summary executions, and the trafficking of Yazidi women. His appointment proves that the new Syrian leadership has no intention of reforming, including, or rebuilding. It is merely recycling radical figures under a thin layer of institutional varnish, while continuing to pursue a policy of ideological and sectarian exclusion. The unilateral constitutional declaration issued by al-Joulani — without consultation or respect for the country’s diversity — confirms a clear intention to impose an authoritarian Islamist vision on Syria.

**Is there a high risk of a renewed civil war?**

Yes, the risk of a return to full-scale civil war is currently very high and should not be underestimated. The rise of sectarianism is palpable. What deeply concerns me is the level of hatred I have observed among some Sunni diaspora communities towards the country’s other ethnic and religious groups. This open hostility only adds fuel to the fire.

Moreover, another particularly dangerous factor is the presence of foreign jihadist fighters in Syria. Al-Joulani is reportedly considering granting them Syrian nationality — a decision that would directly threaten the country’s demographic, political, and social balance. Such a move could only exacerbate internal tensions and trigger another collapse — this time in the form of a large-scale intercommunal conflict.

**Could Syria implode if Charaa’s regime, already resting on a fragile base, were to collapse?**

Yes, Syria faces a real risk of implosion if al-Joulani’s regime — already weak and supported by a narrow base — were to fall. This is precisely why I am working closely with various Syrian components, including Sunni representatives, to build a credible alternative: a federal or decentralised project, inspired in part by the Spanish model. This initiative seeks to preserve Syria’s unity while acknowledging its diversity. The capital, Damascus, must remain a shared, pluralistic space, as it has historically been.

We do not have the luxury of time: fragmentation is accelerating, and tensions are worsening. Yet I firmly believe in this project because it is being led by Syrians themselves — and it will be financed and developed without dependence on external agendas.
