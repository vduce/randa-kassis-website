<b>Summary:</b>

In a wide-ranging interview from Damascus, Randa Kassis, President of the Pluralistic Society Movement, discusses Syria’s critical transitional phase following the collapse of the former regime and the rise of Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) as the de facto governing authority. She addresses the mounting political, security, economic, and social challenges confronting the new rulers, amidst widespread uncertainty over the country’s future.

Kassis draws attention to the people’s aspirations for genuine political participation and voices concern over the re-emergence of authoritarianism, now cloaked in new forms of governance. She warns of the instability posed by extremist factions operating within the current authority and emphasises that the forty days since regime change are woefully insufficient for enacting meaningful reform or initiating an inclusive national dialogue.

She calls for authentic political pluralism, the establishment of independent political parties, and the adoption of a neutral constitutional framework free from sectarian or ethnic dominance. Kassis remains sceptical of HTS’s ability—or willingness—to rein in extremist groups or to foster a truly inclusive political landscape. She also criticises the restrictions placed on participation in national dialogue, urging broader inclusion to develop a shared political project.

On the international front, Kassis stresses the need to balance the interests of global and regional powers—Turkey, the United States, Russia, China, and Iran—if Syria is to achieve stability and begin reconstruction. She advocates a geographically decentralised political model that respects the country’s diversity, including Kurdish representation. The ongoing Israeli incursions are of grave concern to her, particularly in light of Syria’s current weakness, which renders it incapable of mounting an effective deterrent.

Despite the daunting challenges, Kassis remains cautiously optimistic. She affirms that with inclusive participation and international cooperation, Syria may yet chart a path to recovery. Nonetheless, she warns that extremist threats, geopolitical entanglements, and institutional exclusion continue to pose significant risks.
