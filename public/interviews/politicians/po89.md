<h4>When a Section of the Syrian Opposition Descends into Totalitarianism</h4>

Atlantico  
10 June 2013  

Following the barbaric execution of a teenager accused of blasphemy by Islamist militants, Atlantico obtained the compelling and incisive testimony of Randa Kassis, a leading voice of the secular opposition.

Last Saturday, as François Hollande advocated the supply of arms to the Syrian opposition—now composed almost entirely of radical Islamists—a 15-year-old Syrian boy, Mohammad Qataa, was publicly executed in Aleppo by anti-Assad 'rebels' for allegedly committing blasphemy. This confirmed incident was reported by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a London-based organisation known to be sympathetic to the Muslim Brotherhood and, by extension, to the opposition.

The young secular martyr was brutally killed—shot in the mouth and neck—after being whipped by members of the former al-Nusra Front (Sunni jihadists), now rebranded as the 'Islamic State of Iraq and Syria'. The change in name reflects the increasingly transnational character of the opposition, now aligned with the global Salafist Sunni movement and backed by anti-Shi’ite Gulf states.

'Good citizens of Aleppo, not believing in God is polytheism; cursing the Prophet is polytheism. Whoever blasphemes will be punished in this way', declared the Salafist executioners before murdering the boy in front of his parents—his mother having pleaded in vain with the (foreign) militiamen for her son’s life. In fact, the boy’s other 'crime' was his participation in peaceful pro-democracy demonstrations in Aleppo.

Since last year, large areas of the city have fallen under the control of Salafist brigades such as al-Nusra and other armed Islamist or Brotherhood-aligned groups, financed by Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and the wider Al-Qaeda network. In numerous rebel-held neighbourhoods, Sharia law—interpreted in its most totalitarian form—is being enforced by non-Syrian Sunni Islamists who seek to turn Syria into the epicentre of a new regional Sunni Caliphate, pitted against the ‘infidel’ Alawites and Christians, as well as their Shi’ite allies from Iraq, Lebanon, and Iran.

In the north of the country, the Syrian flag is increasingly being replaced either by the black banner of the 'Salafist International' or the green flag of the 'Muslim Brotherhood International'. In this emerging 'Syrian jihadistan', executions of 'apostates', Christians, Druze, Shiites, Alawites, atheists, and 'opposition agents' unwilling to submit to a totalitarian Sharia are becoming commonplace. Thousands of Christians—Orthodox, Maronites, Armenians—have suffered assaults, extortion, and rape. Many have been forced to flee the country. Thousands of Alawite civilians have been targeted by Sunni jihadists, now waging a crusade against Shi’a-affiliated sects. Yet Western media, subservient to Gulf petro-monarchies, remain largely silent—for fear of undermining the reckless scheme championed by the Fabius–Hollande–Cameron axis to arm Islamists and Brotherhood-linked rebels in Syria.

That said, it would be unjust to reduce the anti-Assad opposition to mere bands of mediaeval Salafists. As in Tunisia and Egypt—and more recently in Turkey in opposition to Erdogan—the Arab Spring began with democratic, often secular-minded activists. However, these were later outmanoeuvred, either at the ballot box by Islamist parties (as in Morocco, Tunisia, and Egypt), or on the battlefield by armed Sunni militias.

<b>One figure from this secular and peaceful strand of the Syrian opposition is Randa Kassis—a Christian by background, but an atheist and a committed secularist. She is also deeply sympathetic to Kurdish and Alawite minorities. In other words: unclassifiable and independent. Randa is the founder and president of the Movement for a Pluralistic Society, which proposes a confederal and peaceful solution to the Syrian conflict. She denounces the increasing executions of alleged 'pro-regime civilians'.</b>

<b>She considers the jihadist drift within the Sunni opposition—which, like the regime, is guilty of war crimes—entirely unacceptable:</b>

'I’ve heard reports of several executions of Alawites, Druze, and Christians, killed merely for not being Sunni. These Islamist rebels have nothing in common with the original peaceful Syrian democrats, who never wanted an Islamic state'.

<b>Kassis explains that, over time, foreign Islamist organisations—largely funded by Qatar—have discredited the opposition to Bashar al-Assad. She reminds us that the leader of al-Nusra is a Jordanian, and that this totalitarian Salafist movement is filled with foreign fighters who have no stake in Syria’s future: Iraqis, Tunisians, Libyans, Chechens, Algerians, even Afghans. She offers a striking example of the daily Islamist excesses:</b>

'At a checkpoint in Aleppo, the al-Tawhid brigade barred a secular Sunni man from passing through to deliver aid to civilians because he was wearing shorts. "Our women cannot see a man’s bare legs", he was told. A foretaste of a re-Islamised Syria'.

<b>Kassis observes that many Syrian Sunnis are increasingly embracing a religious identity that is overtaking their fragile national identity. She believes that:</b>

'The future cannot lie in a centralised Arab Muslim state. It must be a flexible federation that allows different groups to live according to their own cultures, rather than forcing them to cohabit—something they no longer desire… The Kurds already have their own administration in the north… Syria must be redrawn into several regions. That is the key to weakening the central security apparatus—and the best way to bring down Assad'.

<b>She deeply regrets the opposition’s categorical refusal to negotiate with the regime:</b>

'Unfortunately, the diplomatic solution came far too late. France and Britain made a grave mistake in recognising the National Coalition—dominated by the Muslim Brotherhood and staffed by arrogant, incompetent, and irresponsible individuals—as the sole legitimate representative of the Syrian people. No single opposition force can represent such a diverse population'.

<b>According to her, minority members of the Coalition—be they Christian, Druze, or Alawite—do not represent their communities’ interests, but instead serve as puppets of the Brotherhood, pan-Arabists, and hardline Islamists. This is why they oppose the Geneva II peace conference proposed by the US and Russia:</b>

'This Coalition is meaningless. It cannot even control the militias. Powerless and unrepresentative, its members must seek legitimacy by submitting to the most extreme Islamist brigades on the ground—including frenzied jihadists such as al-Nusra and the "Descendants of the Prophet". They are irresponsible and inexperienced. They don’t understand that negotiation is part of war itself', Kassis declares.

'I no longer believe in the fairy tale of the "evil regime versus noble rebels". The regime won’t fall through military means. Next month’s Geneva conference will not succeed, not only because the opposition refuses dialogue, but also because the regime is regaining ground—reclaiming Aleppo, recapturing neighbourhoods in Homs, securing victory in Qusayr, and so on'.

<b>Regarding the Franco-British proposal to arm the opposition, Randa considers it:</b>

'Utter madness, which will inevitably prompt Iran, Russia, and Assad’s allies to escalate their own arms support—leading only to further bloodshed… It’s tragic. Both sides seem hell-bent on obliterating one another'.

<b>In her view, France and Britain are just as irresponsible as the National Coalition in pushing the EU and UN to recognise it and to lift the arms embargo on the rebels by the end of August:</b>

'It’s a dangerous move for peace and will sabotage any potential ceasefire or diplomatic solution'.

<b>Randa Kassis laments the transformation of the Syrian civil war into a regional geopolitical and sectarian conflict:</b>

'Iraq, already deeply unstable, is even more precarious. Lebanon has suffered violent spillover effects, especially since Hezbollah and Iran began militarily supporting Assad’s regime. The Gulf states themselves—home to significant Shiite minorities—are increasingly implicated. And Iraq, now largely dominated by pro-Assad Shi’ites, is becoming a major theatre in the regional Sunni–Shi’ite conflict'.

<b>Regarding neighbouring Turkey, governed by the so-called 'moderate' Islamists of the AKP (Prime Minister Erdogan’s party), Kassis also criticises the ambiguous ambitions of:</b>

'The new Sultan Erdogan, who appears intent on re-conquering Syria—once an Ottoman province—and installing a future Sunni Islamist regime in Damascus under his influence'.

<b>She concludes with a sobering prediction:</b>

'The Geneva II Conference will either not happen or be repeatedly delayed—in any case, it is already compromised. Initially planned for May, it was postponed to 10 June, then to July… Sadly, there is no miracle solution to stop the bloodshed in Syria. I don’t believe in a military solution, nor even a short-term political one. In the medium term, the only option I foresee is a federal Syrian state where the rights of minorities—Kurds, Alawites, Druze, Christians—are genuinely protected'.
