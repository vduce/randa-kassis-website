<h4>A Conversation with Randa Kassis on the Discussion of the Proposed Russian Constitution for Syria</h4>

Al Itihad Press

<b>Summary:</b>

In this interview, Randa Kassis, President of the Astana Platform, reflects on the political stagnation afflicting the Geneva negotiations and discusses the ongoing role of her initiative in seeking a political resolution to the Syrian crisis. She explains that the Astana Platform did not participate in the most recent Geneva rounds due to political pressures and deliberate exclusion, including a veto by the French government.

Kassis criticises the performance of UN Special Envoy Staffan de Mistura, describing his approach as both biased and ineffective, and calls for his replacement by a more competent and impartial figure. Despite these setbacks, she affirms that the Astana Platform remains engaged in Geneva through its constitutional work, collaborating with international legal experts to revise a draft constitution initially proposed by Russia.

The conversation underscores that a military resolution to the Syrian conflict is neither viable nor desirable. Kassis instead advocates a clear separation between military and political tracks, emphasising the need for an inclusive, negotiated constitution that genuinely reflects the diversity of Syrian society.

She firmly rejects accusations of alignment with the Assad regime, stressing that the platform holds no ties with the government and was among the first to support Assad’s departure. Cooperation with Russia, she clarifies, is a pragmatic approach to pursuing an internationally recognised political settlement—not an endorsement of the regime.

Kassis also comments on the current absence of the United States from the Syrian file, attributing this to shifting domestic priorities, and expresses concern that this vacuum hampers progress. Nevertheless, she remains cautiously optimistic, seeing potential for renewed momentum should a capable new UN envoy be appointed.

The interview concludes with her vision of the Astana Platform as a forum for serious constitutional dialogue—one that brings together opposition figures, independents, and civil society actors in an effort to lay the foundations for a new, just, and representative Syrian state.
