**Exclusive Interview with Randa Kassis (PART TWO)** _Le Diplomate_ 13 August 2024 By Roland Lombardi

Randa Kassis, a Franco-Syrian politician, anthropologist, writer, and President of the Movement for a Pluralistic Society, served as co-chair of the delegation representing the secular and democratic Syrian opposition during the Geneva peace talks. In 2015, she launched the Astana Platform, which convened various Syrian opposition figures on multiple occasions and subsequently helped shape the Syrian negotiation process. Within this framework, she held numerous meetings with Russian, Turkish, Western, Saudi, and other international leaders. In this second part of her interview with Le Diplomate (see Part 1), she provides an overview of the current state of the Russia–West crisis and the Russo-Ukrainian war, which she has been closely monitoring since the outbreak of the Syrian civil war and Russia’s annexation of Crimea.

**What is your assessment of the extraordinary Ukrainian military incursion into Russian territory in the Kursk Oblast, launched on 6 August, which caught the Russian army off guard—unprepared and seemingly lured into a trap that may compel it to divert resources from Ukrainian fronts where it has been making steady gains? Is this a last stand, a strategic manoeuvre ahead of future negotiations, or simply a publicity stunt aimed at boosting the morale of Ukrainian troops and their allies?**

Although limited in scope, the Ukrainian army’s incursion is unlikely to take them very far. I struggle to comprehend the rationale behind this strategy, which seems unsustainable for Ukraine in the long run, particularly deep within Russian territory. Ukrainian forces lack both the requisite equipment and sufficient manpower to maintain this new front over time. At best, it constitutes a temporary embarrassment for Moscow. The Russians have undoubtedly underestimated the Ukrainians’ resolve to demonstrate their capacity to strike within Russian territory—even if such action borders on the suicidal. As is often the case, following its initial miscalculations—not least the failure to secure its borders—Russia will adapt after absorbing the initial blow. Its response will be more forceful, which will only further complicate any prospects for peace negotiations, contrary to what is being suggested in certain pro-Western media outlets…

In a typically American style of communication, one can clearly discern Washington’s hand in this incursion, the likely objective of which was to bolster Ukrainian positions ahead of potential negotiations and to compel the Russians into a defensive stance, thereby stretching their resources. In my view, the Ukrainians erred in heeding the advice of their American backers—something they may yet come to regret. One of the Patriot systems supplied by the United States to Ukraine was, in fact, destroyed by Russian forces in the Kursk Oblast, despite the Ukrainian army possessing only a limited number of such systems, which are urgently needed elsewhere along the front line… Furthermore, Russian reprisals have already commenced, striking Kyiv and other targets with even greater intensity than before.

**Given that the US Congress has released further aid to Ukraine, will that suffice to prevent Russia from securing victory, even as the Russian army has been steadily—albeit slowly—advancing for several months now?**

It seems rather unlikely. Although the delivery of long-range ATACMS missiles will inflict damage on Russian territory, the difficulties facing Ukraine continue to mount. The principal issue is the shortage of combat-ready soldiers, with the recruitment of new conscripts proving virtually impossible. Wisdom — not a virtue particularly esteemed by Europeans — would suggest that pressure be applied in favour of realistic negotiations in Ukraine. The “lads” President Macron would like to send to Odessa are unlikely to be sufficient to alter the course of events…

**If American aid is accompanied by sustained European support — with an increasing number of long-range missiles, additional aircraft, and possibly more air defence systems — will the Russians be able to hold out for long? With reports of 1,000 casualties per day, will they not also become exhausted and begin to suffer setbacks once the Ukrainians are rearmed?**

Caution is warranted with regard to the figures disseminated by all parties involved. It appears that approximately 200 ATACMS missiles are to be delivered, along with some British missiles and a few medium-range French ones. There is also the matter of a limited delivery of F-16 aircraft — drip-fed, subject to considerable delays and requiring complex training. Despite some successful targeted strikes and occasional significant damage inflicted on the Russian side, this does not appear sufficient to shift the balance of power. At best, we are merely enabling the Ukrainians to buy time. The Russians have managed to reinforce their military capacity to such an extent that they could potentially sustain this war for years. The question remains: what will be left of Ukraine after all these years of conflict?

**How do you perceive the evolution of the situation in Ukraine? Has Putin fallen into a quagmire? Or perhaps NATO?**

No one is mired in a quagmire. Ukraine will be abandoned, as other countries have been in the past, once it becomes clear that the so-called Western “strategy” is yielding no tangible results. I’ve heard it said before that the Russians had stumbled into a quagmire in Syria and that Syria would become Russia’s Vietnam. To this day, none of those predictions has materialised.

**Do you believe the United States will eventually abandon its Ukrainian protégés once Trump comes to power, or—like in Iraq, Syria, or Afghanistan—once they decide it is time to blow the final whistle, thereby deserting their allies and proxies?**

The Americans have already shown a clear tendency to abandon—or even betray—their occasional allies. As for the Europeans, they are devoid of any coherent strategy or analytical foresight. The fatigue and weariness of the Ukrainian population, coupled with that of its allies, is inevitably leading to a significant decline in support for Kyiv. The emergence of new conflicts—such as in Gaza, potentially Lebanon, or even Taiwan—has diverted their attention towards other priorities. None of this plays in Kyiv’s favour.

**In your view, what could be the possible terms of a negotiated end to the war?**

To initiate genuine peace negotiations, it would be preferable for the Ukrainian government to adopt a more realistic position, rather than waiting for the slow but certain destruction of its entire territory. As for Russia, it should temper its territorial ambitions. That said, it must be acknowledged that Ukraine is hardly being aided by allies who continue to operate in a delusional and detached reality. The absence of genuine political leadership in the West only exacerbates the situation.

**What do you make of the peace plan for Ukraine proposed by Viktor Orbán to the European Union—which promptly rejected and condemned it—following his informal diplomatic tour as Hungarian Prime Minister (with Hungary currently holding the rotating EU presidency), during which he met with the leaders of China, Ukraine, Russia, and the former US President and current presidential candidate, Donald Trump?**

I do not seriously believe that the Russians are prepared to negotiate anything at this stage. At the same time, this peace plan for Ukraine, which has been endorsed by Beijing, cannot be openly dismissed by Moscow. I doubt that even the Chinese—or indeed the Hungarians themselves—genuinely believe in it at present. Orbán’s plan, which was first presented to Donald Trump and subsequently to the Chinese—who had already been working on a similar proposal—was a diplomatic manoeuvre aimed at portraying him as a peacemaker. The Russians gave it only a token endorsement out of courtesy, in order not to reject an initiative put forward by friends and allies. Regrettably, I see no realistic prospect for negotiations in the immediate future—unless the Ukrainians were to agree to cede the occupied territories, effectively accepting Russian terms. The recent Ukrainian incursion into Russian territory will only exacerbate the situation; far from advancing peace, it has made the Russians even more intransigent and uncompromising.

**And what of the European Union? Has it become the fool in the Ukraine war—paying more than the United States for a conflict that is inflicting considerable harm, particularly in terms of soaring energy prices?**

Europe is a farce, and foolishness comes at a steep price. Buying refined petroleum products from India at inflated prices—despite the crude oil still originating from Russia in defiance of sanctions—borders on criminal idiocy.

**Is there any coherence in French diplomacy, which has recently become the most vocally anti-Russian in the West, yet seems markedly more accommodating towards China? For example, President Emmanuel Macron made a major concession to Beijing by allowing Total to draft its hydrocarbon contracts in yuan rather than in US dollars for the first time.**

That merely demonstrates that Total has a long-term strategic vision. The President simply followed the lead set by Total. As for Macron himself, he has repeatedly—often to a ludicrous degree—demonstrated his lack of vision and understanding of the modern world. He seems to be floating somewhere above reality, and we still have no idea which planet he inhabits.

**Do you believe China is constructing, alongside Russia, an anti-American and anti-Western front with the aim of dismantling the post-1945 American-led world order once and for all? Is this Russo-Chinese alliance—one increasingly aligned with the world’s most authoritarian regimes, such as Iran’s theocracy and North Korea—preparing for a third world war with the strategic objective of toppling the liberal international order established by the United States and its Western allies?**

I do not truly believe that a third world war is imminent, as it would serve none of the major powers’ interests. However, Europe and the United States have gravely underestimated the emergence of powerful alliances capable of challenging them. We are speaking of countries such as China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Brazil, and others. Today, nearly all sanctions imposed on Russia can be circumvented thanks to these new partnerships. We are now living in a new global disorder, where alliances are increasingly forged through bilateral agreements rather than multilateral frameworks.
