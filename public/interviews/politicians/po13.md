<b>Summary:</b>

In an extensive and candid interview, Franco-Syrian politician Randa Kassis, President of the Astana Platform, delivers a penetrating analysis of current geopolitical dynamics in the Middle East, focusing on the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, the Syrian civil war, the rise and resilience of Islamist groups, and the role–or absence–of Western powers in shaping the region’s future.

Kassis begins by challenging the notion that Hamas can be fully eradicated, noting its deep-rooted support among segments of the Arab population and its survival strategy of blending in with civilians. She underscores the long-standing failure to dismantle ideologies through military means alone and warns that children raised under bombardment risk becoming the next generation of extremists.

She views the Abraham Accords as effectively stalled, asserting that Hamas has succeeded in halting Saudi–Israeli normalisation. Iran, she suggests, emerges as a strategic victor, possibly positioning itself to further capitalise on the resulting instability.

Turning to Syria, Kassis dismantles the narrative that Bashar al-Assad has “won” the war. She highlights the fractured nature of Syrian territory and society: Assad governs less than half of the population, the economy lies in ruins, and anti-government protests have even emerged within the Druze and Alawite communities. Meanwhile, Syria has degenerated into a narco-state, with the regime and its allies–particularly Maher al-Assad–deeply embedded in the Captagon drug trade.

Kassis attributes the marginalisation of Syria’s secular opposition to Western short-sightedness. Despite early efforts to unify under a pluralistic platform, secular forces were sidelined in favour of Islamist factions, notably the Muslim Brotherhood and, at times, even Al-Qaeda’s Syrian offshoot. She sharply criticises the French and American governments for backing Islamist coalitions, quoting a French diplomat who dismissed her as a 'radical secularist' for refusing to align with such groups. For her, this Western naivety–believing it could manipulate Islamists against Assad–was both dangerous and doomed.

On Hezbollah and Iran, Kassis assesses that Hezbollah remains reluctant to open a second front with Israel despite pressure from its base and Tehran. She describes Syria as the 'weak link' in the region, with Assad’s silence during regional escalations betraying his vulnerability.

Kassis reflects critically on the early phase of the Syrian revolution, acknowledging the youth-led spontaneity of protests, but also the rapid hijacking of the movement by Islamist actors. She regrets the idealism and political inexperience of opposition figures, including herself, and emphasises the importance of political – not merely activist – leadership.

Regarding migration, Kassis sees little prospect that most Syrian refugees will return. While some fled war, others sought economic opportunity; but after years abroad, many are now integrated elsewhere. She advocates a political solution without Assad–whose continued presence she views as untenable–but not one that excludes all regime elements. A pragmatic, transitional 'marriage' with certain military actors may prove necessary.

On the European front, she is scathing about France’s waning influence, describing its absence from Syria, Lebanon, and the Israeli–Palestinian file as symptomatic of a broader diplomatic retreat. By contrast, she identifies emerging regional actors–such as Saudi Arabia’s Mohammed bin Salman–as eager to fill the vacuum.

Kassis views the drug trade, particularly Captagon, as a potential leverage point for the Syrian opposition. Highlighting the regime’s central role in its production and distribution, she urges European counterparts to follow the US in adopting a 'Captagon Act' that reinforces sanctions and blocks normalisation.

Finally, when asked whether radical Islamist currents are gaining strength in Europe, Kassis responds with nuance. While she unequivocally denounces Islamist ideologies, she also expresses a deeper understanding of the roots of radicalisation–chief among them, a sense of injustice. She argues that successful integration in Europe requires dispersing migrant communities, not concentrating them in isolated enclaves that preserve the very conditions they sought to escape.

Despite the setbacks, Kassis remains committed to a future for Syria grounded in secularism, the rule of law, and gradual political transition. Her message is both sobering and defiant: the Syrian cause may be battered, but it is far from extinguished.
