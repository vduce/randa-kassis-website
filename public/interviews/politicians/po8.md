**EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW – Randa Kassis: “Federalism is the key to preserving Syria’s pluralism and unity”** _Le Diplomate_ 13 December 2024 By Roland Lombardi and Alexandre del Valle

Interview with Randa Kassis, Franco-Syrian anthropologist, political leader, writer, and president of the Movement for a Pluralistic Society

A leading figure in the opposition to the now-defunct regime of Bashar al-Assad, Randa Kassis has, since the Arab Spring of 2011, championed pluralism and multiculturalism in Syria and the broader Middle East. During the Syrian civil war, she served as co-president of the secular and democratic Syrian opposition delegation at the Geneva peace talks. In 2015, she went on to initiate the Astana Platform, which brought together members of the Syrian opposition and laid the groundwork for the notable negotiations between Turkey, Russia, and Iran. In this context, she has held numerous meetings with Russian, Turkish, American, Saudi, and Iranian leaders.

In this interview with Le Diplomate, Kassis offers her analysis of the abrupt collapse of Bashar al-Assad and the troubling rise of an increasingly Islamist alternative. She also shares her thoughts on the fate of Russia’s strategically important military bases in Syria, which Moscow did not appear willing to defend at any cost. Furthermore, she deciphers the positions of key local, regional, and international actors—Israel, Turkey, Russia, Iran, the United States, and the Gulf monarchies, particularly Qatar—who have long shaped the destiny of this war-torn country. Notably, HTS, led by Mr Joulani, no longer refers to the territory as Syria, but as Cham, the biblical name for the Levant—an intensely symbolic term for jihadists, Muslim Brotherhood affiliates, and neo-Ottomanists seeking to restore either the Umayyad Caliphate of Damascus or Syria’s historic status under the Ottoman Caliphate.

**Could you tell us how Bashar al-Assad relinquished power, reportedly abandoning both his troops and part of his family?**

Joulani struck at the ideal moment: Iran and its proxy Hezbollah were in a weakened position, while Russia was deeply absorbed in the war in Ukraine. Turkey, for its part, saw an opportunity to consolidate its position in northern Syria. That said, Turkey’s support for the offensive must be qualified. While the operation extended as far as Damascus and targeted Assad himself, it is not that Erdoğan would have been displeased by Assad’s departure—rather, his influence over Joulani’s military and political choices remains limited. Some sources suggest that Turkey even opposed the attack on the city of Hama. The true political and financial backing for Joulani—both in Idlib and Damascus—originates from Qatar. Both the Iranians and Russians were well aware that the Syrian army could not withstand such an assault alone, primarily because soldiers were either unpaid or grossly underpaid.

**What became of his siblings Maher, Bouchra, Samer, and Majid? Is it true that Bashar abandoned part of his family? What about the Assad clan and their relatives, such as Rami Makhlouf, who controlled 60% of the Syrian economy after the privatisations of the 2000s?**

Bashar informed few within his family of his departure. His brother Maher, who only discovered the escape belatedly, is believed to have fled—likely to Iraq—possibly accompanied by 2,000 loyal troops to continue, among other things, his Captagon trafficking. It is uncertain whether he remains there. The other two brothers died some time ago, and their sister Bouchra resettled in Dubai following the mysterious death of her husband. Soulaymane Hilal al-Assad, a cousin, was reportedly hanged in public on Monday in an Alawite town. Numerous businessmen and Syrian officials, including Ali Mamlouk, fled to Beirut. The Makhlouf family also escaped to Lebanon, though Rami’s brother was killed during a shootout on the Lebanese border. It appears his mother and one of his brothers were also wounded. As for Samer al-Assad, he committed suicide while under siege.

**Is it true that HTS has carried out summary executions, despite its initial claims of “moderation” after taking power with minimal resistance?**

Yes, summary executions have indeed occurred in Hama in recent days, although we do not yet have the full picture. In certain Alawite villages, fighters stormed in and disarmed residents. I am in contact with individuals on the ground via Elie Afaq, secretary-general of the Movement for a Pluralistic Society, which I chair. They fear a massacre, fully aware that Abu Mohammad al-Joulani cannot entirely control all his fighters—many of whom are hardline jihadists.

**Have the Israelis taken steps to expand their territory, given they have recently seized positions in the Syrian part of the Golan Heights, Joulani’s place of origin? Who are HTS’s main internal and external enemies today?**

Israel has already used the situation to destroy remnants of the old Syrian army’s arsenal and has extended its borders into Syrian territory, asserting that this expansion is temporary. I remain highly sceptical of that claim, as what is labelled “temporary” may well become permanent, depending on how the international community responds and how regional dynamics evolve. HTS currently lacks the capability to push Israeli forces out of the Golan. I fear that Israel will annex additional territory under the pretext of ensuring its own security. Joulani will soon face formidable adversaries, including Russia, the United States, and Iran.

**Can we assess the relative military strength of the HTS and ANS coalitions?**

Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), led by Abu Mohammad al-Joulani, comprises approximately 30,000 fighters. It has become one of the most powerful rebel forces in Syria, dominating Idlib province for years and playing a central role in breaking the regime’s defensive lines. That said, it is important to note that Joulani only entered Damascus the day after its fall. What the Western press overlooked is that it was, in fact, the Southern Brigade—a local faction operating in the Daraa region—that entered the capital as the regime collapsed. Joulani arrived the following day. The Southern Brigade also played a key role in operations against government forces, including

the seizure of tanks. However, their numbers remain limited and difficult to determine accurately, particularly following the 2018 reconciliation agreements. As for the Syrian National Army (ANS), it consists of between 50,000 and 70,000 fighters, mainly active in Turkish-influenced areas in northern Syria along the Turkish border. The ANS has participated in operations against both the Syrian regime and Kurdish forces.

Meanwhile, the Maghaweer al-Thawra (MaT)—a small brigade supported and effectively controlled by the United States—operates in the al-Tanf region with around 200 to 300 fighters. Also known as the Revolutionary Commando Army, this group controls the area surrounding the strategically located al-Tanf base, near the junction of the Jordanian and Iraqi borders. Despite its limited manpower, the brigade plays a key strategic role in regional dynamics.

**Will the new interim government in Damascus face severe economic difficulties if US Caesar sanctions are not lifted swiftly? What are the potential consequences?**

Naturally, the interim government may rely in the short term on aid from Qatar, which supports several Islamist factions globally, particularly HTS in Syria. This might satisfy some basic needs of the population for the time being. However, the scale of resources required to revive an economy under sanctions—with no indication that these will be lifted in the foreseeable future—renders the outlook bleak. Any serious reconstruction effort would demand immense resources and a level of stability that is currently absent. As things stand, the United States has shown no intention of lifting sanctions or repealing the Caesar Act.

**Will Iran attempt to restore ties with Syria by offering financial assistance for reconstruction?**

Iran is likely to strengthen its strategic alliance with Russia, as their interests increasingly converge. Tehran will undoubtedly seek to reassert its influence in Syria in the medium term. However, instability in Iraq may complicate its ambitions, particularly as Moqtada al-Sadr—an influential Shiite cleric and politician—is displaying signs of political restlessness. Al-Sadr, based in Kufa near the Shiite holy city of Najaf, is the son of the late Ayatollah Mohammed Sadeq al-Sadr (executed by Saddam Hussein in 1999). Since 2018, he has emerged as a leading figure in Iraqi nationalism and is increasingly viewed as a challenge to Tehran, from which he seeks independence.

**The revolution last Sunday led to the release of numerous foreign jihadists, including French nationals. Do they now pose a threat to Europe and the region?**

These jihadists did indeed participate in the fall of Bashar al-Assad. Approximately ten were identified during the capture of Damascus. Syria is currently believed to host between 100 and 200 French nationals who have already been convicted in France. A particularly dangerous group from Idlib has renewed its allegiance to Joulani and HTS. It is associated with the Franco-Senegalese preacher and recruiter Omar Omsen, whose network has ties to the Chechen responsible for the murder of Samuel Paty and individuals involved in the Charlie Hebdo attacks.

However, it remains unclear whether the jihadists currently seen operating within HTS or other groups—including Daesh—were recently released from prison or had been acting covertly. It is worth noting that the prisons holding Daesh terrorists in Syria are under the control of the SDF (Syrian Democratic Forces), a largely Kurdish-led coalition. In any case, it is certain that HTS includes foreign fighters in its ranks. This is far from reassuring.

**Will Joulani maintain a degree of moderation, despite the presence of hardline jihadists within his ranks? Idlib, his stronghold, is said to remain heavily infiltrated by jihadist cells, including French-speaking fighters from the Omar Omsen network.**

Even if Joulani sought to adopt a more moderate image, he would likely be unable to exert full control over these jihadist elements. It is true that in recent years, he has softened his rhetoric towards minorities—particularly Christians, who are tolerated as dhimmis. Nonetheless, we must not overlook the harsh reality faced by Muslim women, who remain subjected to strict rules derived from a rigid interpretation of Islam. These women have no individual freedoms and are controlled by the hisba, HTS’s religious police, which enforces Sharia law. HTS has now officially declared Sharia the law of the land in Syria.

**How will the ANS and HTS—and, by extension, the Turks behind them—overcome the Kurdish forces in the East? Will the Americans defend the Kurds with their 1,000 troops, or will Trump once again abandon them, as he did in 2019 in a deal with Erdoğan?**

Without American military backing, it will be extremely difficult for the Kurds to resist the combined forces of HTS and ANS. That said, Kurdish forces have demonstrated remarkable resilience on numerous occasions. Trump currently seems to favour disengagement, but he will soon be faced with the reality of a renewed terrorist threat. His newly appointed counter-terrorism chief, Sebastian Gorka, is known for his strong stance against radical Islam. It remains unclear whether Trump fully grasps the long-term implications of a hasty US withdrawal from the region.

**What is your plan or proposal for Syria? What would you suggest to the new American administration, given your familiarity with the Trump family?**

We must remain open to dialogue with all parties. At the same time, Syria’s political forces must find common ground and agree on the future structure of the state. I continue to advocate federalism, which I believe is the most realistic solution for preserving territorial integrity while safeguarding Syria’s pluralism. I also hope that Israel will respect Syrian sovereignty. I have already initiated dialogue with some members of the incoming American administration and remain optimistic that we can work together constructively.
