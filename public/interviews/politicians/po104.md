**Interview with Randa Kassis – Spokesperson for the Syrian Secular Current** _Al Jadida_ 7 December 2011 By Mostafa Emara

In recent days, Cairo has seen the arrival of several prominent figures from both the internal and external Syrian opposition, who have gathered to coordinate their positions on mechanisms to bring down the Syrian regime and to forge a shared vision for Syria’s future. These meetings also included consultations with Arab League officials—foremost among them the Secretary-General—regarding the role the League and Arab states should play in the forthcoming phase. Against this backdrop, we conducted the following interview with Randa Kassis, spokesperson for the Syrian Secular Current and member of the Syrian National Council:

**How do you view the impact of the Arab League sanctions on the Syrian regime, particularly amid concerns they may harm the people more than the regime itself?**

The economic sanctions issued by the League are inadequate. They are left to the discretion of signatory states, allowing them to implement—or ignore—them at will, thereby granting the Syrian regime additional time. Naturally, any sanctions will affect the people—though this is not the intention. The goal is to target the merchant class aligned with the regime. This regime cannot survive if the merchants of Damascus and Aleppo turn against it. For that to happen, sanctions must be robust and uncompromising.

**What steps should be taken in the next phase?**

We must acknowledge that sanctions do not produce immediate results. To hasten the regime’s fall, the Syrian issue must be internationalised and referred to the UN Security Council. Practical steps must be taken on the ground to protect civilians from killings and repression. This includes adopting a resolution to establish both a buffer zone and a no-fly zone, which would enable the Free Syrian Army to defect more easily from the regular army and reorganise itself more effectively.

**But many in the Arab world are concerned that internationalising the conflict could threaten the stability of Syria and the wider region, particularly since major powers—especially the United States—are chiefly concerned with ensuring Israel’s security. How do you respond to that?**

Unfortunately, we are still burdened by outdated and rigid ideologies that equate foreign intervention solely with colonialism and military invasion. We must choose the option that entails the least loss—such as imposing a no-fly zone that would allow the Free Army and refugees to remain in a safe area. If the Free Army proves unable to protect civilians, then we must escalate our demands and call for military intervention through targeted strikes against the regime.

It is important to realise that no global power seeks to colonise this region militarily—they already dominate through their products, because we are peoples who do not produce. The world today is structured around mutual interests between nations. If the West intervenes, it is of course to serve its own interests, but that could simultaneously serve ours. We must move beyond reactionary ideas and embrace a reciprocal exchange of interests.

**How do you explain the swift Arab and international intervention in Libya, in contrast with the hesitation surrounding Syria?**

Indeed, there has been hesitation among both Arab and Western governments when it comes to taking decisive action against the Syrian regime. This is due to several factors, most notably the fear of extremist Islamist movements dominating society. Some may even consider the current regime more ‘peaceful’ towards Israel. Furthermore, Syria’s future remains unclear, especially with regard to the fate of minorities, who comprise around 35% of the population. Arab regimes, for their part, are afraid that the winds of the Syrian revolution may sweep into their own territories and destabilise them.

**Do you believe the regime’s alliances with Iran and Russia may prolong its survival?**

Certainly, Iranian support plays a key role in extending the regime’s lifespan. Russia is a different matter—its relationship is based on shared interests, such as the naval base in Tartus. Russia wants to maintain its strategic presence there, regardless of who holds power. I believe Russia’s stance could shift under sufficient pressure.

As for Iran, it forms a strategic triangle with Syria and Hezbollah. If the Syrian regime were to fall, that link would be broken—Syria serves as the connecting point between Iran and Hezbollah. Keeping Iran preoccupied with internal issues, like its nuclear file, could pressure it to choose between supporting the regime or pursuing its nuclear ambitions. Ultimately, it comes down to whether Western powers genuinely want the regime to fall, or whether they remain hesitant. In any case, Iran cannot support this regime indefinitely. In the end, it is the Syrian people’s determination to protest and make sacrifices that will shorten the regime’s life and compel both regional and international communities to act.

**If the regime responded with reforms, could a compromise be reached to keep it in place with changes?**

We must distinguish between the regime’s leadership and its foundations. The Syrian people are calling for the departure of the head of the regime—if not more. However, we must also recognise that an entire system cannot be dismantled overnight. The head can go, while the base may be integrated into future democratic processes.

In my view, the head of the regime is incapable of reform. Had he intended to enact reforms, he would have done so after the Tunisian revolution or at the onset of the Syrian protests, which initially demanded reform—not regime change. His only response was repression—because repression is all he knows.

The optimal way to avoid chaos is for the military generals to abandon the regime’s head. The West could incentivise this by dropping international charges and allowing them to remain safely in Syria.

**What is your assessment of Turkey’s position, particularly regarding the possibility of a buffer zone along the border?**

What matters is action on the ground. Declarations must be translated into tangible measures—namely the creation of a buffer zone enforced by a no-fly zone.

**Given that certain segments of the Syrian opposition are not represented in the National Council, do you believe the Council in its current form genuinely represents the opposition?**

The National Council will never encompass all components of the Syrian opposition. The issue of inclusion remains unresolved. I believe unifying the opposition should stem from a shared vision to topple the regime—not from drafting political programmes, as significant ideological differences exist.

At present, the Council behaves as though it will govern post-Assad Syria. It must recognise that we are still in a transitional phase. The current priority is to establish a mechanism for regime change. How can we squabble over spoils while blood is still being shed?

**Does this imply that the opposition, in its current form, does not reflect the suffering of the Syrian people and is, in fact, prolonging the regime’s survival?**

Indeed, the current state of the opposition is extending the regime’s lifespan. The revolution was born in the streets, but the opposition—through its actions, its egos, and its scramble for leadership—has stifled it. This revolution is not about replacing one ruler with another. Syrian opposition figures must come to terms with this.

**In recent years, secularism has receded in the face of rising Islamist currents. What, in your view, are the reasons for this decline?**

We must first understand the reasons behind the rise of extremist Islamist currents alongside the decline of secular movements. The primary factor, in my view, is authoritarian regimes, which actively contributed to this retreat. Secular and liberal currents were more heavily repressed by these regimes.

Furthermore, secular movements lacked the financial resources necessary to organise and unite—unlike Islamist groups, which received substantial funding and had access to satellite channels to promote their ideas. These platforms enabled them to reach deep into society.

Humanitarian organisations linked to these groups also provided services to poorer communities. While authoritarian regimes did persecute Islamist groups, that persecution was political rather than social.

To counter this, secular movements must cooperate to form a genuine force advocating for individual freedom. They must also build communication channels with the public—through secular newspapers or television networks—to explain what secularism truly is, as many still mistakenly equate it with Western cultural subversion or moral decay.

**The Arab public often associates secularism with atheism. Do you think a new secular discourse is needed to better connect with the public?**

Secularism means separating religion from public affairs. I believe religion is a personal matter, and everyone must respect the choices of others. A believer whose faith is strong should not fear atheism.

We must therefore craft new narratives that nurture a culture of mutual respect and acceptance. The problem lies in how religious figures shape minds. If we are to criticise political repression, we must also address the tyranny of clerics and their influence over political thought.

**Do you believe current developments require a secular–Islamist dialogue to establish common ground while preserving each side’s beliefs?**

Dialogue is the only path to common goals. As secular currents, we seek a constitution grounded in international human rights law. But the question remains: are extremist Islamist movements willing to cooperate with us on that basis? We are not trying to eliminate anyone—but we reject any attempt to impose one vision over others.

**Do you expect an Islamist wave to sweep through Syria if the regime collapses?**

Despite the presence of minorities—who represent at least 35% of the population—and secular currents comprising 10–15%, the possibility remains. However, we must look to the long term.

Arab societies continue to dream of political Islam as a means of restoring dignity and easing the psychological frustrations endured for generations. Yet in the long run, these movements will fail, as they lack clear economic strategies capable of lifting societies out of poverty and corruption. We will certainly face challenges. Islamist movements gained experience while out of power—but governing is another matter entirely.
