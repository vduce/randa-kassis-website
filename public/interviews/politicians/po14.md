**Syria is Blackmailing Europe** _Il Libero_ 23 April 2023 By Andrea Morigi

The threat of jihadism remains a concern,” says opposition figure Randa Kassis, “but an even greater danger looms: the trafficking of Captagon, a powerful stimulant manufactured in Assad-controlled factories.”

Having long vanished from the radar of Western media, Syria abruptly returned to the spotlight following the arrest in Messina of a young migrant suspected of belonging to the jihadist group Jabhat al-Nusra. To assess whether this incident signals a resurgence of jihadist activity in Europe, we spoke with Randa Kassis, President of the Astana Platform and a prominent Syrian opposition figure.

**Do you see a threat linked to illegal immigration?**

One must not underestimate the possibility that fleeing Syrian extremists may seek refuge in Italy under the guise of asylum before moving on to other parts of Europe. As for Jabhat al-Nusra, I do not believe they are currently plotting attacks. They have never carried out operations abroad. On the contrary, they are attempting to gain Western acceptance in order to avoid being designated as a terrorist organisation. Their leader, Abu Mohammed al-Jawlani, has even gone so far as to shave off his beard.

**Yet they remain on the UN terror list.**

Of course—and it cannot be ruled out that some extremist elements remain within their ranks. The likelihood of coordinated attacks has diminished, but the risk has not vanished entirely. Still, the greater danger today comes not from jihadist groups, but from Damascus.

**In what way?**

Through blackmail involving Captagon—the synthetic stimulant often dubbed the ‘jihadist drug’. The narcotics trade has become the Assad regime’s only reliable source of income, reportedly generating $57 billion annually, while the Syrian population remains mired in poverty amid a protracted economic and humanitarian crisis. Numerous factories across Syria produce Captagon and distribute it abroad via the Lebanese Hezbollah network.

**Which countries are most affected?**

Primarily neighbouring states: Lebanon, which provides a maritime route, followed by Jordan and, further afield, Saudi Arabia. Both Amman and Riyadh have urged Assad to curb the flow of Captagon. As a result, the regime has been forced to seek new markets.

**Such as?**

Europe. Here, the regime has allegedly forged ties with Italian organised crime. Do you recall the massive drug bust at the port of Salerno in 2020? That seizure involved 84 million tablets originating from Syria’s narco-state. In the Middle East, a year later, 400 million tablets were intercepted.

**Do you believe the drug is still being smuggled into Italy for distribution across Europe?**

Absolutely. It is a form of blackmail: lift the economic sanctions, or we will continue to flood your countries with drugs. And let us not forget—narcotics revenues lie beyond the reach of international sanctions.

**Are Western governments aware of the scale of the problem?**

Sadly, I must say that rather than confronting the crisis, European institutions appear to be asleep at the wheel. That is why we are holding a closed-door conference in Brussels on 27 April.

**THE REGIME AND ORGANISED CRIME**

Damascus has forged a pact with Italian criminal networks. In 2020, 84 million Captagon pills were seized in Salerno, shipped from Syria’s narco-state. A year later, 400 million were intercepted in the Middle East.

**THE NARCOSTATE**

For Assad’s regime, the narcotics trade has become its sole source of revenue, bringing in $57 billion annually while the Syrian people starve. Numerous factories across Syria produce Captagon and export it through the Hezbollah network.
