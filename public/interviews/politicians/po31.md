**Randa Kassis’s Interview: Assad is a “burnt card** _TV5 Monde_ 22 April 2018

**Summary:**

In this segment, Randa Kassis, politician and author of Syria and the Return of Russia, addresses the geopolitical and diplomatic repercussions of Western airstrikes in Syria, Russia’s role in the conflict, and her vision for the country’s political future.

Kassis reaffirms her longstanding belief that Russia is the only state capable of guiding Syria towards a realistic and achievable political settlement. Drawing on her years of cooperation with the Russian government, she argues that the recent Western strikes were less an assault on the Assad regime and more a strategic message to Moscow—set against the broader backdrop of escalating tensions and a Cold War-style climate, marked by sanctions on Russian oligarchs and the UK’s accusations of Russian involvement in a poisoning incident.

Regarding Russia’s military intervention in 2015, Kassis maintains that it was a strategic necessity: Moscow could not allow Syria to fall entirely under Iranian influence, given Tehran’s already entrenched presence on the ground. Russia’s involvement, she contends, was aimed at preserving its regional influence and stabilising Syria as a strategic ally.

Kassis is sharply critical of Western policies towards the Syrian opposition, accusing several countries of having naively supported Islamist and jihadist factions—often via Qatar—through financial and military backing. This, she claims, led to unintended consequences, including the transfer of weapons to extremist groups. She attributes the rise of these Islamist brigades to Western “amateurism”, noting that secular opposition platforms such as her own were sidelined and excluded from major diplomatic frameworks.

She also argues that Bashar al-Assad has not genuinely “won” the war, despite recent territorial gains achieved with Russian support. In her view, Assad is a “burnt card” who cannot remain in power indefinitely. Nevertheless, she acknowledges that he remains a temporary fixture in the political equation due to his regime’s involvement in the constitutional process.

Kassis concludes by asserting that it is the secular opposition—those who participated in the Sochi and Astana negotiations—that will ultimately contribute to Syria’s future government, rather than the Islamist factions previously backed by Western and Gulf powers. She emphasises the need for pragmatism and sustained international engagement with Russia as essential to securing a lasting political transition in Syria.
