As the date of the Geneva peace talks approaches, the Syrian opposition finds itself entangled in both logistical preparations and internal disagreements over representation. The Higher Negotiations Committee (HNC), which represents a broad spectrum of opposition groups, is convening in Riyadh to form its delegation. Meanwhile, the political body of the Syrian National Coalition has just concluded a three-day preparatory meeting in Istanbul. These parallel efforts underscore the deep divisions within the opposition and the difficulty of presenting a unified front.

Complicating matters further, several armed factions—many of which took part in the Astana talks—have begun demanding a larger share of representation in the Geneva negotiations. Their insistence on greater involvement has triggered disputes over the legitimacy and composition of the opposition delegation. The situation has also prompted a shift in the role of the United Nations. While the UN Special Envoy had initially considered appointing opposition delegates directly, he has since stepped back from this plan due to factional tensions, and may instead opt to issue personal invitations.

A televised debate featuring prominent figures such as Randa Kassis, Chair of the Astana Platform; Dr Yahya Al-Aridi, adviser to the HNC; and Rami Al-Dalati, member of the Supreme Council of the Free Syrian Army, offered a revealing glimpse into the broader coordination challenges. The discussion highlighted persistent disagreements over how to balance military and political representation, achieve legitimacy and inclusiveness, and engage with external powers such as Russia.

Randa Kassis argued that no single group could claim to represent the Syrian opposition in its entirety. She rejected what she described as the 'monopolisation' of opposition voices and emphasised the need for pluralistic representation across various platforms in line with UN resolutions. She also drew a clear distinction between political and military tracks, asserting the Astana Platform’s right to participate in political dialogue despite its lack of involvement in ceasefire negotiations.

From the military side, Rami Al-Dalati and other representatives of armed factions maintained that their presence in Geneva was not only legitimate but essential. As those tasked with enforcing ceasefire arrangements, they insisted that political progress was impossible without their direct involvement. They stressed that many fighters were, in fact, politically conscious civilians who had taken up arms in response to the conflict—not professional soldiers devoid of political perspective.

Despite these arguments, the opposition remains deeply fragmented. Various platforms—including the HNC, the National Coalition, the Astana and Moscow platforms, and independent groups—continue to vie for influence. In the absence of an electoral or representative mechanism within Syria, questions of political legitimacy remain unresolved. Moreover, while political actors aim to lead discussions on constitutional and institutional reform, they are also forced to confront pressing security concerns that only armed factions can address.

There is also widespread scepticism regarding the role of external actors. Russia, in particular, is seen as an unreliable guarantor of ceasefires, especially in light of recent escalations and attacks on the ground. Previous rounds of the Astana talks failed to produce a durable ceasefire, further complicating any hopes for meaningful negotiations in Geneva. Participants in the debate agreed that without tangible improvements on the ground—chiefly, a sustained ceasefire—political negotiations risk becoming irrelevant.

Nonetheless, there was consensus on the broader vision: a political transition grounded in UN Security Council Resolution 2254. This includes constitutional reform, the establishment of new governance structures, and an end to the Assad regime’s dominance. To achieve this, all parties emphasised the urgent need to overcome factional rivalries and form a united, credible delegation capable of speaking on behalf of the Syrian people. Without such unity, the opposition’s role in shaping Syria’s future remains severely compromised.
