<h4>Geneva VIII Will Not Deliver Without a Clear Opposition Strategy</h4>

<b>Summary:</b>

Randa Kassis offered a critical assessment of the prospects for the eighth round of the Geneva peace talks, asserting that it would likely mirror the failures of previous rounds. Despite the formation of a unified opposition delegation in Riyadh and the marginalisation of more hardline elements, she argued that these procedural improvements remained ultimately superficial and inadequate in addressing the fundamental shortcomings of the opposition’s approach. Chief among these, she noted, was the lack of political professionalism and strategic coherence within the delegation—factors that severely undermine its capacity to engage effectively in negotiations.

Kassis was particularly critical of the opposition’s inability to counter the tactics of Bashar al-Jaafari, the regime’s representative, who, in her view, seeks more to provoke and delegitimise the opposition than to engage in any serious political dialogue. She emphasised that the delegation not only lacks the experience required for high-stakes diplomacy, but also suffers from an absence of a clear vision for Syria’s future. This includes a notable failure to articulate a coherent framework for a new Syrian constitution—an instrument she considers essential to laying the foundation for a credible political transition.

Moreover, Kassis highlighted the geopolitical and territorial realities on the ground, drawing attention to regions currently outside the regime’s control—such as Kurdish areas and territories held by various opposition forces—which, she suggested, must be considered for some form of decentralised or self-administrative governance within a unified Syrian state. In her view, any viable political solution must be grounded not only in a realistic assessment of power dynamics, but also in an inclusive constitutional process capable of addressing the aspirations of all Syrians.

Ultimately, she concluded that without a well-defined negotiating agenda, clear objectives, and a long-term strategic vision, the opposition risks perpetuating a cycle of ineffective dialogue and missed opportunities. For Geneva VIII to transcend symbolism and move towards meaningful political engagement, it must be underpinned by a serious, technically competent, and politically mature opposition—one capable of negotiating not merely for survival, but for the reconstruction of a viable Syrian state.
