**Has the War for Civilisation Begun?** _France 5 – Les Grandes Questions_ 26 November 2015 Presented by Franz-Olivier Giesbert Guests: Hélène Carrère d’Encausse, Michel Eltchaninoff & Randa Kassis

**Summary:**

The programme tackled the provocative question of whether the world is entering a new era marked by a war of civilisations. Far from offering simple answers, the discussion explored the ideological, geopolitical, and cultural forces reshaping global affairs.

Hélène Carrère d’Encausse, a renowned historian and permanent secretary of the Académie française, rejected the idea of an inevitable civilisational clash in the Huntingtonian sense. Instead, she argued that we are witnessing the resurgence of a civilisation that had long been in decline—the Islamic civilisation—now in search of itself, its values, and its place in the modern world. She framed this revival not as a confrontation with the West, but as a process of internal transformation, albeit one that inevitably spills over into global affairs. In this context, Carrère d’Encausse highlighted Russia’s unique position: a nation straddling both East and West, with a vast Muslim population and a historical identity as the protector of Eastern Christians. She underscored Moscow’s enduring strategic interests in the Middle East, tracing a continuum from tsarist policies to present-day realpolitik.

Randa Kassis, a Syrian politician and outspoken secularist, brought a sharp and politically grounded perspective to the discussion. She recalled her early warnings about the rise of jihadist movements in Syria—warnings that she believes were ignored by Western powers due to a dangerous combination of naïveté and geopolitical short-sightedness. Kassis strongly criticised what she described as the West’s blindness to the ideological dimension of Islamist radicalisation. In her view, Western democracies have made serious strategic errors by supporting regimes like Saudi Arabia and Turkey, which, she asserted, have directly or indirectly enabled the proliferation of extremist groups under the guise of regional influence or Sunni leadership. She lamented the lack of a unified European strategy, noting that France in particular had adopted an inflexible and moralistic approach to the Syrian conflict, which ultimately served to alienate potential partners and undermine realistic solutions. For Kassis, any political resolution in Syria must involve both Russia and Iran—not out of idealism, but because they are simply indispensable players on the ground.

Michel Eltchaninoff, philosopher and specialist in Russian thought, turned the discussion towards the ideological landscape underpinning current Russian policy. He provided a detailed analysis of Vladimir Putin’s intellectual influences, especially his appropriation of conservative religious and philosophical traditions. Chief among these was the émigré thinker Ivan Ilyin, whose writings espoused a spiritualised, nationalist vision of Russia’s destiny—ideas that Putin has reportedly embraced and cited. Eltchaninoff argued that Putin is not merely reacting to Western liberalism but actively constructing a conservative counter-narrative that presents Russia as the moral and geopolitical antithesis of a decaying West. This narrative has proven attractive not only within Russia but also among political movements across Europe’s far right and far left, both of which share a disdain for liberal universalism and globalism. He questioned whether Putin’s military intervention in Syria was genuinely aimed at defeating ISIS, suggesting instead that the preservation of the Assad regime and the projection of Russian power were the true motives. In this sense, Russia’s involvement became emblematic of a broader ideological and civilisational posture: the assertion of an alternative world order rooted in sovereignty, tradition, and multipolarity.

As the discussion unfolded, the participants reflected on whether today’s upheavals signal a profound civilisational rupture, a reassertion of long-suppressed identities, or the forging of a new multipolar balance of power in which Western dominance is no longer assured. The conversation bridged historical analysis, political realism, and philosophical critique—offering a nuanced and often disquieting portrait of the forces at play in the contemporary geopolitical arena.
