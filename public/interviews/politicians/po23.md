**Bashar al-Assad Is Now a Spent Card** _Al Jadid TV_ 17 Juin 2020 By Ramez al-Kadi

**Summary:**

Randa Kassis, President of the Astana Platform for the Syrian opposition, delivered a sharp and unflinching analysis of the Syrian crisis, framing it primarily as an economic collapse rather than a military conflict. While acknowledging that the Caesar Act and international sanctions have deepened the regime’s paralysis, she noted that these measures alone will not bring about the fall of Bashar al-Assad. His fate, she asserted, lies in the hands of the principal international actors—chiefly Russia and Turkey—who continue to dictate the direction of Syria’s future.

Kassis described Assad as a “spent card,” a political figure who has outlived his usefulness, even to some of his closest allies. The regime, she argued, has become unsustainable not due to battlefield losses, but as a result of a spiralling economic crisis that has rendered reconstruction, refugee return, and the resumption of normal governance virtually impossible.

She recalled that the Astana Platform had long opposed the militarisation of the Syrian uprising, having anticipated that armed confrontation would ultimately play to the regime’s advantage. Today, she believes, the economic siege imposed by sanctions may gradually create the conditions for political change—though not necessarily through pressure alone. Assad, in her view, is incapable of engaging in meaningful negotiations, and the current UN-led political process, particularly the Constitutional Committee, has failed to deliver any substantive progress.

Kassis rejected the notion that the opposition as a whole has failed, emphasising that it is not a single, monolithic entity. Rather, it comprises diverse platforms, individuals, and experiences—some of which have indeed faltered, while others have remained active and effective. She positioned the Astana Platform as one such initiative that has continued to put forward concrete proposals, including an early constitutional draft and consistent diplomatic engagement.

Looking ahead, she stressed that no viable solution—political or economic—can emerge without redefining Syria’s strategic role in the region. Without such a shift, the country will remain mired in paralysis, and reconstruction will remain out of reach.
