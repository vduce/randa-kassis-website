<b>Summary:</b>

This episode centres on Vladimir Putin’s calculated return to the global diplomatic stage, marked by his address to the UN General Assembly and a tense, much-anticipated meeting with US President Barack Obama. Putin is cast as a geopolitical tactician par excellence—likened to a chess grandmaster—who seizes upon Western indecision to reposition Russia as a pivotal actor in the Syrian conflict. His call for an international coalition against Daesh, coupled with steadfast support for Bashar al-Assad, constitutes a deliberate challenge to Western interventionism and a bold reassertion of Russian influence in the Middle East.

Although Russia has significantly ramped up its military presence in Syria—particularly through deployments in Tartus and Latakia—its operations have primarily aimed to fortify the Assad regime rather than to target Daesh directly. The principal ground forces engaged against Daesh remain Iran and Hezbollah. In contrast, France insists on Assad’s departure and an end to regime-led aerial bombardments of civilians as prerequisites for any viable international coalition. France’s own airstrikes in Syria are justified under the doctrine of legitimate self-defence, intended to pre-empt jihadist attacks on its soil.

Amid this polarisation, Randa Kassis, a member of the Syrian opposition and president of the Movement for a Pluralistic Society, asserts that any realistic political resolution must go through Moscow. She argues that the immediate removal of Assad is untenable, particularly given Russia’s entrenched military and diplomatic foothold. Instead, she proposes a phased transition process: beginning with internationally supervised parliamentary elections, followed by the formation of a national unity government comprising both opposition and regime representatives. Assad’s exit, she contends, should be the culmination—not the starting point—of a carefully negotiated settlement.

Kassis also underscores a disquieting reality: the majority of anti-Assad rebel factions are Islamist in orientation—often radicalised and fundamentally at odds with Western democratic values. Groups such as al-Nusra and Ahrar al-Sham, she insists, cannot be seen as credible partners in a post-Assad Syria. The real challenge, therefore, lies not merely in removing Assad, but in constructing a credible, secular alternative—something the West has thus far failed to deliver. Her emphasis remains firmly on political realism: a rejection of both authoritarianism and naïve idealism.

The broader discussion in the programme lays bare the labyrinthine complexity of the Syrian conflict, with its intricate web of competing regional and global interests. While consensus holds that Daesh constitutes the most immediate threat, defeating it militarily demands more than aerial campaigns; it requires coordinated ground operations and, crucially, a coherent political vision for Syria’s future. Such a vision remains elusive so long as the Assad question continues to divide key stakeholders.

In conclusion, the episode suggests that a sustainable resolution in Syria will require not only military pragmatism and diplomatic coordination, but also intellectual honesty and moral clarity. Randa Kassis’s intervention stands out: she calls for a politics grounded in reality rather than ideology. Only by confronting the uncomfortable complexities of the conflict—and by including all relevant actors, including Russia and Iran—can the international community begin to chart a path out of devastation. Syria’s fragile and uncertain future may yet depend on a willingness to engage those long excluded from the negotiating table.
