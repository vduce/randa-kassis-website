<b>Randa Kassis—a trenchant opponent of Bashar al-Assad and trained in both psychology and the anthropology of religions—has recently founded a new political party: the Movement for a Pluralistic Society. Entirely secular.</b>

'I am an atheist'.

The statement lands with the force of a declaration. Kassis delivered it unprompted during a press conference at the Hôtel Scribe in Paris on Wednesday, 10 October—an event that, notably, attracted only a modest media presence.

'And I’ve been one since the age of twelve'.

The line, direct and assertive, seems crafted to resonate with Western audiences, especially in a climate increasingly marked by anxieties over religious extremism. She has stated it on numerous occasions.

A journalist and anthropologist by training, Kassis was born into a Christian family in Damascus. Her attachment to secularism took root early.

'I began asking difficult questions from the age of eight… The first was about Eve. Her supposed inferiority unsettled me'.

Her outlook diverged sharply from that of her devout mother, with whom she always maintained a respectful yet distant relationship. It was her father, a psychologist, with whom she shared a particularly close bond—and from whom she learned—'to think for herself'.

'I first rebelled against the Church, then against religion as a whole… and eventually against Syrian society and its social codes'.

At seventeen, seeking greater autonomy, she left Syria to join her sister in Germany and study fashion design. 'But I didn’t continue'.

She later turned to psychology. She laughs—a quiet, sincere laugh, unguarded.

'I’ve always been a bit resistant to formal education systems', she adds, describing Germany as 'far too regimented' for her temperament. France, by contrast, captivated her immediately.

'These rigid educational structures suppress individual freedom of thought. We ought to reduce the conditioning imposed on children'.

<b>A Family of Contrasting Convictions</b>

Her political involvement seems almost accidental. 'My father was active in an anti-Assad party, but I only discovered this much later'.

Still, the bond she shared with him appears to have shaped her political stance. 'He suffered psychological persecution under Hafez al-Assad’s regime'…

When her father died of cancer in 1990, Kassis chose not to attend the funeral—a decision she now reflects on with a lingering sense of guilt.

'I think I internalised more than I realised… and in a way, I believe I ended up following the principles he held dear'.

For nearly a decade, she immersed herself in the arts as a means of self-exploration—her father’s influence ever-present—before turning to writing. Her first paintings? 'Nude women'

She smiles. 'Precisely because the body is taboo in the Arab world'. A quiet provocation. A consistent spirit of rebellion.

Is Randa Kassis a feminist? Not in the conventional sense.

'The problem with certain strands of feminism is that they assume women are always right… but women too must take responsibility. In some respects, they have also chosen submission'.

That said, she insists on the importance of 'becoming accustomed to seeing women in leadership positions in the Arab world, in order to reshape perceptions'. Her current political engagement, then, represents 'a real challenge'.

A challenge she has already begun to take on, having been chosen to lead the Coalition of Secular Forces, formed in September 2011 by members of the Syrian diaspora and various opposition groups abroad.

'I think they valued my background, my writing… but above all, the fact that I was willing to say what many others wouldn’t'.

Yet decades of intercommunal tension in Syrian society have posed a significant obstacle to the coalition’s progress.

'We worked very hard, but the deeper problem lies in our cultural history… It’s something common to societies that have experienced long-term repression. Communities are often forced to fight for survival—sometimes at the expense of others'.

This is precisely the kind of challenge her new party seeks to confront.

<b>Challenging Assad’s Regime—and Sharing Power with Moderate Islamists</b>

Randa Kassis announced the launch of her new party alongside several prominent Syrian figures. Among the secular leaders: Bassam Ishak, Executive Director of the Syrian Organisation for Human Rights since 2005 and a member of the Syrian National Council since 2011, and Abdulaziz Othman, a Kurdish member of the same council and of the Yekiti Kurdish Party.

Under Kassis’s leadership, the Movement for a Pluralistic Society aims to represent all segments of Syrian society—ethnic, religious, and ideological—in their full diversity.

'I don’t wish to attack the Syrian National Council', she says, 'but it does appear to be influenced—and possibly financed—by certain extremist Islamist groups'.

The party’s first objective is to help bring about the fall of the Assad regime. The second: 'to govern and to share power', including with moderate Islamists.

Kassis is unequivocal in her views on religious extremism.

'I studied the anthropology of religions… and throughout history, every theocratic government or kingdom has curtailed individual freedoms. Some societies have yet to shed the cultural legacy that fuses religion with Reason. But for me, it’s crucial to learn to separate thought from emotion'.
