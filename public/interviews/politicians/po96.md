<b>Summary:</b>

The text addresses a hunger strike launched by a group of Syrian women—including poets, activists, and artists—in protest against the dire humanitarian situation in Syria. They are calling for urgent relief operations, the establishment of humanitarian corridors, the imposition of a no-fly zone, and the creation of buffer zones to protect civilians. Their strike serves as a gesture of solidarity with the Syrian people, whose suffering has persisted for over two years. However, the women remain sceptical about the international community’s willingness to heed their demands, given the complexities of global politics and the intransigence of the Syrian regime.

The strike coincided with initiatives in Paris to establish the “Pluralistic Civil Society” movement, which seeks to build a democratic, civil, and pluralistic state in post-Assad Syria. This movement, led by Randa Kassis, underscores the vital role of Syrian women in spearheading political and social change. The episode also featured messages of international solidarity from activists across the globe and emphasised the widespread opposition to direct military intervention. Instead, many advocated for indirect support measures to guarantee civilian protection.

The hunger strike continues as a form of political and humanitarian pressure on the international stage, accompanied by a warning that the suffering will endure in the absence of tangible action.
