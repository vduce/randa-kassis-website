Syrians Believe the Leader of the Armed Opposition Will Not Share Power The Opposition in Syria Doubts al-Joulani’s Willingness to Share Power

MOSCOW, 12 Dec – RIA Novosti. The leader of the armed opposition in Syria, Ahmad al-Sharaa (better known as Abu Mohammad al-Joulani), is unlikely to allow the political opposition to assume a significant role in the governance of the country, said Randa Kassis, head of the Syrian opposition 'Astana Platform', in a statement to RIA Novosti.

'At present, al-Joulani is capitalising on the situation by appointing his own officials based on an established organisational structure and his administrative experience in \[Idlib province – ed.\]. However, there is little chance that the political opposition—whether based in Istanbul or represented by other platforms such as ours—will be granted any meaningful role', Kassis stated.

According to the opposition figure, engaging with al-Sharaa is proving rather difficult, primarily due to his past. 'It remains to be seen in practice whether he has genuinely become a secular figure—especially given that he now controls territories far larger in scale than Idlib', she added.

Kassis emphasised the importance of the external political opposition remaining open to dialogue, albeit with heightened caution.

'Al-Joulani may make certain concessions, such as dropping the requirement for women to wear the hijab, but the extent of his pragmatism is still in question. The fall of Bashar al-Assad gave rise to hope, yet the challenges Syria faces in the coming period are immense', Kassis explained.

The head of the Astana opposition platform called on all opposition forces to convene a general assembly to establish a unified vision for Syria’s future, including proposed amendments to the new constitution. In her view, such a gathering should mark the first step towards a comprehensive political transition.

On 8 December, members of the armed opposition seized the state television headquarters in Damascus and announced live on air that they had taken control of the country. Syrian Prime Minister Mohammed Ghazi al-Jalali stated that he, along with several ministers, remained in the country and had established contact with the leadership of the armed opposition.

The Russian Foreign Ministry reported that President Bashar al-Assad, following negotiations with several parties to the conflict, agreed to step down and leave the country, instructing that power be transferred peacefully. Russia, however, did not take part in the negotiations.

A source within the Kremlin told RIA Novosti that Assad and his family had arrived in Moscow, where the Russian Federation had granted them asylum. The source also noted that Russian officials were in contact with representatives of the armed Syrian opposition, whose leaders had given assurances regarding the safety of Russian military bases and diplomatic missions.

The Astana Platform was established by representatives of the external Syrian opposition following a series of meetings on Syria held in Astana. The external political opposition remains decentralised and divided into several so-called platforms or groupings—the most prominent of which, alongside the Astana Platform, include the Istanbul, Cairo, and Moscow Platforms.

In 2017, the head of the Astana Platform, Randa Kassis, launched an initiative to draft a new Syrian constitution, involving Syrian academics and political figures—an effort that was, at the time, supported by the Russian Foreign Ministry.
