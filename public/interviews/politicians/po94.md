**A New Secular Opposition Party** L’Humanité 18 October 2012

A leading figure in the Movement for a Pluralistic Society, Randa Kassis sets out her aims.

The Movement for a Pluralistic Society, a newly established Syrian opposition party, has just been formed. At its head stands Randa Kassis – a woman – a powerful symbol in itself. “I am an atheist and the president of this movement. That alone gives us reason for hope,” she told L’Humanité.

Initially a member of the Syrian National Council (SNC), Randa Kassis was later expelled. “From the beginning, it was clear that the Muslim Brotherhood was manipulating the SNC,” she asserts. “I wanted to warn Syrians about the rise of Islamism, the infiltration of jihadists, and to denounce the abuses committed by certain armed factions operating under the banner of the Free Syrian Army (FSA). That did not go down well.”

Committed to the unity of the Syrian people and to a _“democratic and secular”_ future for the country, Kassis points out that a “silent majority does not support this uprising because it fears Islamisation. As for the Alawite community, it largely refrained from taking part at first out of fear of regime reprisals – and now fears extermination at the hands of those advocating for a greater Islamic Syria.”

The Movement for a Pluralistic Society does not oppose the “legitimacy of self-defence and bearing arms”. However, as Kassis stresses, “what is needed is a structured army with a clear political direction – one composed primarily of defectors, not armed civilians, as is currently the case. This army must operate under a unified military command in coordination with a political body composed of all elements of the opposition and the revolutionary movement, with a commitment to respect its decisions and to surrender weapons to the transitional government once the regime falls.”

In her view, “the militias must be brought under control and wrested from Islamist influence. Most importantly, efforts must be made to encourage the defection of senior Alawite officers.” On this point, she confirms that negotiations are already under way. “These are the necessary conditions for a genuine ceasefire,” she says.

The Movement, which champions gender equality, also seeks to “secure constitutional recognition for the Kurdish people in Syria, along with their national, political, social, intellectual and economic rights.” This is a key issue, given that the Syrian National Council has consistently refused to enter into discussions with Kurdish representatives over such autonomy. In contrast, the National Coordination Committee for Democratic Change includes the main Kurdish movements in Syria.

While the SNC appears to be well-financed – though, as Kassis notes, it is impossible to access the accounts, which are controlled by the Brotherhood – the more secular opposition movements are not so fortunate. Here again, the international community would do well not to turn a blind eye.
