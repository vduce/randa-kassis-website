**Massacres in Syria** _France 5 – C dans l’air_ 14 March 2012 Presented by Yves Calvi Guests: Frédéric Pons, Hasni Abidi, Pascal Boniface & Randa Kassis

**Summary:**

C dans l’air on France 5 marked the first anniversary of the Syrian uprising. What began on 15 March 2011 as a peaceful protest movement swiftly descended into a blood-soaked tragedy, with Bashar al-Assad’s regime responding through a calculated campaign of terror—heavy bombardments of rebel-held areas, mass arrests, starvation sieges, and indiscriminate killings.

Coinciding with the broadcast, Amnesty International released a damning report documenting more than thirty torture techniques systematically employed by the regime, painting a harrowing picture of state-sponsored suppression of dissent.

During the debate, Randa Kassis delivered a forceful denunciation of Assad’s repression, characterising it not as chaotic warfare but as a deliberate and organised campaign of brutality against a defenceless population. She criticised the international community’s failure to intervene, holding Russia and China accountable for repeatedly vetoing UN action in pursuit of their own interests. In her view, these vetoes granted Assad impunity and prolonged the suffering.

Kassis also warned against the regime’s intentional exploitation of sectarianism to fracture national unity and portray the conflict as a civil war. She firmly rejected this narrative, affirming that the uprising was a genuine call for freedom and dignity—not a foreign conspiracy nor a sectarian revolt.

While other guests addressed regional dynamics and Western hesitation, Kassis refocused the conversation on the suffering of the Syrian people. She condemned the regime’s blockade of humanitarian aid and restrictions on media access, stressing that the international community’s inaction stemmed not from ignorance, but from a lack of political will.

For Randa Kassis, Syria’s crisis is not merely geopolitical—it is a profoundly moral one. Any future resolution, she asserted, must place the protection and dignity of the Syrian people at its heart—not strategic interests.
