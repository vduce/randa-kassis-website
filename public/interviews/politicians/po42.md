**What did the head of the Astana Platform call de Mistura?** _Al Jadeed TV_ 27 February 2017 Presented by Ramez al-Kadi

**Summary:**

Randa Kassis is a writer, human rights advocate, and prominent political figure, currently serving as the head of both the Pluralistic Society Movement and the Astana Negotiation Platform. She previously led the General Committee for the Democratic Secular Opposition, a coalition formed in opposition to the Syrian regime. Her career initially began in the arts, working as a visual artist before pursuing studies in theatre and later conducting research in anthropological psychology—an academic background that has significantly informed her socio-political analysis.

In a televised interview with Ramez Al-Kadi, Kassis addressed the exclusion of the Astana Platform from the Geneva IV peace negotiations—an exclusion she attributed to a decision by the then-UN Special Envoy to Syria, Staffan de Mistura. According to Kassis, de Mistura later explained to Russian officials that the decision had been prompted by objections from the French Foreign Minister and the Qatari government, who reportedly took issue with the name and presence of the Astana Platform. Kassis criticised this rationale as both questionable and short-sighted, highlighting the temporary nature of the French Minister’s tenure and questioning the diplomatic logic behind allowing such objections to dictate the direction of the talks.

Kassis voiced serious doubts regarding the Geneva IV negotiations’ capacity to establish the foundations for a credible political process. She pointed to the conspicuous absence of the United States and the limited involvement of Russia as critical factors undermining the legitimacy and potential efficacy of the discussions. She further noted that Moscow had called an emergency meeting of the Syria Support Group in Vienna—a move which, in her view, signalled growing tensions and dysfunction within the broader diplomatic framework.

Beyond structural critiques, Kassis also condemned de Mistura’s style of leadership. She reproached his insistence on convening negotiations before adequate groundwork had been laid, accusing him of prioritising performance over method. Employing a metaphor, she likened his approach to “dancing on or around tables”—a chaotic and ineffective manner which, to her mind, reflected a deeper disorder within the UN-led mediation process. She ultimately branded him a “failed dancer”, suggesting that his leadership had sown confusion rather than fostered constructive dialogue.
