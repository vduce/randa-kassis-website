<b>Summary:</b>

This episode of Neran Sadiqa offers a thorough examination of Western positions on the Syrian conflict, exposing a persistent lack of political will and strategic coherence in addressing the crisis. The West—led by the United States and key European allies—has largely prioritised counterterrorism, focusing on the defeat of ISIS and al-Qaeda while deferring any serious engagement with Syria’s political future. Despite repeated high-level calls for the removal of Bashar al-Assad, such rhetoric has rarely been matched by concrete action or sustained diplomatic planning.

Randa Kassis, featured in the episode, underscores the dangers of this fragmented approach. She criticises both Western and internal Syrian failures, pointing to the West’s early mistake of treating the Syrian opposition as a monolith, with undue favour shown to factions such as the National Coalition. Kassis argues that this narrow recognition marginalised other political actors and ultimately undermined the credibility of the opposition. She emphasises the absence of a genuine Syrian political alternative, warning that the opposition has remained a loose collection of dissenters rather than a structured political force capable of governance. According to her, while Russia may eventually concede to Assad’s departure, the lack of a viable and organised Syrian alternative continues to obstruct any meaningful political transition. Kassis also highlights the unrealistic expectations harboured by the opposition, particularly the erroneous belief that Syria would follow the Libyan model of Western intervention and regime change.

The discussion reveals a Western response plagued by internal contradictions. The assertive rhetoric of the Obama administration was never translated into coherent policy, while the Trump administration shifted focus almost entirely to defeating ISIS, further postponing any political resolution. European powers, for their part, have largely acted reactively—more concerned with stemming refugee flows and addressing domestic security threats than with shaping Syria’s political trajectory. This reactive stance has contributed to the securitisation—and at times, the demonisation—of Syrian refugees, especially under Trump’s leadership.

Meanwhile, the geopolitical landscape has been decisively reshaped by Russian intervention and its alliances with Turkey and Iran. Russia’s dominance in Syrian airspace and on the ground has positioned it as the principal power broker, while Iran has pursued a more ideological agenda through militias such as Hezbollah. Turkey, focused primarily on curbing Kurdish factions it regards as terrorist organisations, remains a critical yet complex actor in the conflict.

The human toll has been catastrophic—over 350,000 deaths and millions displaced—amid an international community that has largely stood by. Political solutions remain deferred until the defeat of extremist groups, yet no comprehensive Western-led vision for Syria’s reconstruction or governance has emerged. Ultimately, as Randa Kassis contends, without a coordinated Western strategy and a credible Syrian political alternative, there can be no sustainable resolution to the conflict, nor a genuine pathway to peace.
