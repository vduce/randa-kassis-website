**Are the United Nations’ Efforts in Syria Sinking into the Quagmire of the Ukrainian Crisis?** _Al Youm TV_ 2 March 2022

**Summary:**

In this interview, Randa Kassis reflects on the far-reaching repercussions of the Ukrainian crisis on the Syrian political process, particularly the stagnating efforts led by the United Nations. She expresses concern over the increasing fragility of the Syrian Constitutional Committee, whose sessions persist despite deep internal divisions, a lack of unified political vision, and an absence of genuine political will.

Kassis highlights the growing unease of UN envoy Geir Pedersen regarding the war in Ukraine and its potential to further undermine the already fragile political track in Syria. She underscores that while the frontlines in Syria have remained relatively static thus far, any shift in Turkish or Russian engagement—both central actors in the conflict—could alter the balance of power, particularly in Turkish-controlled areas.

Despite ongoing meetings, Kassis views the Constitutional Committee as devoid of effectiveness and increasingly resembling a diplomatic formality rather than a body capable of delivering substantive political outcomes. She notes that Turkey’s strategic role could become even more pivotal should Ankara choose to escalate its involvement—whether politically or militarily—within the Syrian arena as part of its broader positioning in the Ukrainian crisis.

Kassis also observes that Russia has, to date, maintained a consistent stance in support of the Syrian government and is unlikely to revise its strategy in Syria despite mounting pressures resulting from its confrontation with the West over Ukraine.

Ultimately, she concludes that the UN-led process has failed to yield any meaningful progress. The Syrian Constitutional Committee operates more as a symbolic gesture than a genuine mechanism for negotiation, laying bare the limitations of international diplomacy amid shifting geopolitical alignments.
