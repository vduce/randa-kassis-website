**No Solution to the Syrian Crisis Without the Participation of the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria** _Al Youm TV_ 5 April 2021

**Summary:**

More than a decade into the Syrian conflict, it is evident that a political solution remains elusive—not for lack of mediation efforts, but due to a convergence of entrenched geopolitical interests, a fragmented opposition, and the regime’s steadfast refusal to relinquish centralised power. In this interview, Randa Kassis reflects on the current impasse, asserting that no meaningful resolution is possible without acknowledging Syria’s complex social fabric and, crucially, including the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria in any future negotiations.

Despite the efforts of successive UN envoys and the establishment of platforms such as Geneva, Astana, and Sochi, international diplomacy has thus far failed to yield tangible results. One major obstacle lies in the divergent interpretations of the Geneva communiqué, which each actor—Russia, Iran, the Assad regime, and Western powers—has manipulated to suit its own agenda. Even within Russia, internal divergences have hindered progress: while certain factions once appeared amenable to compromise, others—particularly within the Foreign Ministry—remain determined to preserve Assad’s grip on power.

On the side of the opposition, fragmentation continues to thwart any genuine attempt at unity. Far from articulating a coherent or democratic vision for Syria, many opposition groups remain disconnected from the country’s pluralistic reality. Kassis has long maintained that federalism—or at the very least, a form of decentralisation—is not an ideological preference but a pragmatic necessity. A centralised state cannot adequately reflect Syria’s ethno-religious diversity, and any attempt to impose unity from above is destined to fail.

The role of external powers has further compounded the crisis. The United States, increasingly preoccupied with its rivalry with China and broader strategic interests in Asia, has largely disengaged from serious involvement in Syria. Russia continues to support Assad for geopolitical reasons, though it lacks a coherent long-term vision and may eventually be compelled to reassess its stance under the weight of economic pressures and sanctions. Iran, meanwhile, sees Assad as indispensable to its regional influence, while Turkey prioritises its campaign against Kurdish forces, actively working to exclude the Autonomous Administration from all political processes.

This exclusion, Kassis argues, is both unjust and counterproductive. The Autonomous Administration governs a significant expanse of territory, has played a central role in the fight against terrorism, and represents a genuine political force on the ground. Marginalising it not only undermines prospects for a future constitutional settlement but also reflects a refusal to engage with Syria’s lived reality.

Syria today is a fractured society, economically devastated and burdened by sanctions. The regime has grown increasingly disconnected from its population, with Assad politically paralysed and incapable of proposing viable solutions. Within this context, a sustainable resolution requires a comprehensive political and economic framework—one that acknowledges the country’s pluralism, includes all relevant actors, and is grounded in diplomatic realism rather than ideological rigidity.

If peace is to be achieved, it must be inclusive, pragmatic, and willing to confront uncomfortable truths. Anything less will merely prolong the suffering of the Syrian people.
