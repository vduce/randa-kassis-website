<h4>Randa Kassis: “In Syria, the Russians represent some hope!”</h4>

While the United States appears increasingly open to negotiating with Damascus, the secular Syrian opposition figure Randa Kassis welcomes the inter-Syrian dialogue already initiated by the Russian government. From December 2011 to August 2012, Kassis was a member of the Syrian National Council, representing the secular and democratic current, before being expelled. She now heads the “Movement for a Pluralistic Society”.

<b>On Sunday, US Secretary of State John Kerry stated that dialogue with Bashar al-Assad would eventually be necessary to achieve peace in Syria. What is your reaction?</b>

If this position is confirmed, it demonstrates realism and pragmatism. It reflects well on John Kerry. Whether we like it or not, Assad remains a force on the ground. He is part of the problem, but also—clearly—part of the solution. This shift in the State Department’s stance brings it somewhat closer to Russia’s position on the Syrian conflict.

<b>Indeed, Russian diplomacy initiated an inter-Syrian dialogue in Moscow from 26 to 29 January 2015, bringing together representatives of the Assad regime and non-Islamist opposition figures. The goal: replacing war with a political settlement. You took part in this first round on the opposition’s side. What were the outcomes?</b>

The first positive outcome was that, for the first time, direct dialogue took place between members of the opposition and regime representatives. During the much-publicised Geneva II talks in January and February 2014, discussions were merely indirect, each side addressing the UN and Arab League’s special envoy, Lakhdar Brahimi.

The second encouraging development was that all thirty-two opposition delegates and the six regime diplomats (whose delegation was led by Syria’s UN Ambassador, Bashar Jaafari) agreed on the need to continue the dialogue. A second round is scheduled for 6 April, once again in Moscow and over four days.

A third notable achievement was the regime’s agreement—at our request and with Russian support—to release prominent secular opposition figure Louay Hussein, who had been detained since 13 November 2014. Today, Russia represents a rare beacon of hope in the Syrian context.

<b>Given that Moscow has consistently armed the regime since the start of the 2011 protests, can we really trust its role as mediator?</b>

It is precisely because Russia is an ally of Damascus that it is best placed to persuade the regime to soften its intransigent stance. The long-standing relationship between Moscow and Damascus—alongside the regime’s military and partial financial dependence on Russia—gives the Kremlin considerable leverage in shaping a political solution. In short, Russia is indispensable in this crisis.

<b>What do you believe Russia’s ultimate objective is in launching this initiative?</b>

The strength of Russian diplomacy lies in its pragmatism. Moscow is under no illusions. It recognises that peace will not be restored overnight or simultaneously across all regions. Its preference is for a gradual, region-by-region approach.

<b>Which regions do you have in mind?</b>

The first step is to reach an agreement between the regime and non-Islamist, reasonable opposition groups in areas currently under regime control. This should lead to the formation of a national reconciliation government, in which Bashar al-Assad could potentially assume a transitional role. The new government would then define both its allies and its enemies, with the aim of eradicating radical Islamist groups. The Kurdish PYD are natural allies in this effort—they demonstrated both courage and effectiveness during the battle of Kobani.

<b>And what about Aleppo?</b>

The UN Special Envoy, Staffan de Mistura, has proposed freezing front lines and establishing a ceasefire around Aleppo. All opposition figures who travelled to Moscow support his mission, in the hope of easing civilian suffering.

<b>Is a ceasefire realistic while Turkey continues to allow jihadists to cross its borders?</b>

It is high time Turkey clarified its position. Is it a friend or a foe of the West? Thus far, it has obstructed every peace initiative and provided military and financial support to Islamic State jihadists. Turkey has played the sorcerer’s apprentice, driven by an obsession with the Kurdish issue and a nostalgic desire to revive Ottoman influence. Erdogan is not far from being a radical Islamist. Many were deceived by his polished exterior, mistaking it for moderation. In truth, he seeks to establish an Islamic state in Turkey. He has moved from concealment—practising the traditional Muslim taqiyya—to openly flaunting his intentions with arrogance.

<b>Unlike the French government, do you believe Iran should be involved in resolving the Syrian crisis?</b>

Two years ago, Laurent Fabius opposed the participation of an Iranian delegation at the first Geneva conference. Today, opinion in Paris appears more nuanced. A growing number of politicians and diplomats now recognise the need to engage with reality and ultimately include Iran in any resolution of the Syrian crisis.

<b>Why do you say “ultimately”?</b>

There are necessary steps to follow. First, the regime must reach a reconciliation agreement with the opposition. Second, this agreement must be ratified by the United Nations. Third, Iran should be invited to join negotiations with the new transitional government. And fourth, the Gulf petromonarchies and Turkey must be held accountable for their role in the conflict.

<b>In August 2012, you were expelled from the Syrian National Council (SNC), which the French government continues to recognise as the sole legitimate representative of the Syrian people. What happened?</b>

I became aware of abuses committed by armed rebel groups against civilians. As early as 2012, I warned of the jihadist threat within the armed opposition. Most members of the SNC dismissed my analysis as “far-fetched”. I was a lone voice in the wilderness.

At the time, much of the French Foreign Ministry, the media, and various think tanks were caught up in wishful thinking—convinced of the regime’s imminent collapse and of the SNC’s supposed influence on the ground. In reality, the Council—later rebranded as the “Coalition”—never had any genuine credibility inside Syria. It merely gathered Syrians living abroad, most of whom had been in exile for decades and were heavily influenced by Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait. All the weapons supplied by France were either stolen or sold off immediately to the most radical Islamist factions.
