<h4>What Lies Behind the Notion of the 'Moderate Syrian Opposition'?</h4>

What lies behind the infamous notion of the 'moderate Syrian opposition'? Is it truly that far removed from jihadism? Randa Kassis, co-author of Le Chaos Syrien, shares her perspective with RT France.

<b>A young boy was beheaded by the so-called moderate Syrian opposition. A video of the act was posted online on 19 July. How can we distinguish what constitutes the moderate Syrian opposition and what does not?</b>

First and foremost, the label 'moderate rebels' or 'moderate opposition' was originally assigned to Islamist rebels and to the Syrian National Coalition, which was backed by the West. It referred to 'moderate Islamists', not secularists or politically moderate opponents.

Today, the term “moderate” has lost all meaning. It has been so widely and carelessly applied that, to be perfectly frank, I now feel ashamed to describe myself as a moderate opponent. I am a secular political opponent who advocates gradual change in Syria—in coordination with Russia.

The term 'moderate' is now devoid of substance, as all the so-called 'moderate Islamists' supported and armed by the United States and the West are Islamists before anything else. We witnessed the throat-slitting—not a beheading, but a brutal slaughter—of a child by a group claiming to be moderate Islamists, allegedly affiliated with the Free Syrian Army. This is yet another example proving that these are not people with whom negotiation is possible.

I have been saying this for years: there is no such thing as armed moderate Islamist rebels. They simply do not exist. An Islamist is, by definition, a potential jihadist. We must be honest and courageous enough to acknowledge that openly.

<b>There was recently a meeting between John Kerry and Sergey Lavrov, during which their positions appeared to converge regarding the so-called moderate opposition. Do you think this rapprochement could have any effect in the fight against Islamic State and the so-called moderate Islamists?</b>

I do not believe the United States has any genuine intention of combating the moderate Islamists. We have already witnessed numerous atrocities committed by these so-called moderates—the throat-slitting of that child is just one example. Regrettably, in my view, the United States is unlikely to put an end to this. There is no serious will to pursue a progressive solution for Syria. I place considerable trust in Russian policy—I have always believed Russia represents a source of hope for the Syrian people. It can guide the country towards gradual transformation, but this must be achieved step by step.

To initiate a political process, one must be realistic. We must proceed with great caution in order to protect the Syrian population from these Islamist factions. That, fundamentally, is what a political process should entail.

Until now, the West has firmly supported what it calls a coalition—which, in truth, is not a coalition at all but a delegation from Riyadh known as the High Negotiations Committee. These individuals cannot represent or support any progressive or political solution, as their sole objective is to see Bashar al-Assad fall at any cost. They lack both a programme and a vision for what comes next.

They want to topple the Syrian regime, but they are so weak that, should they succeed, Islamist forces and other armed rebel groups would simply fill the vacuum. This Riyadh delegation is disconnected from reality; it would not even be capable of governing the country. These individuals are not committed to a political solution—they are seeking a military one. They have no understanding of negotiation. Europe has aligned itself with Saudi Arabia’s position, while Turkey is utterly incapable of contributing to a viable political solution in Syria.

<b>Following the tragic death of the young boy, the US State Department stated that it would not suspend its support for the opposition, citing insufficient evidence. Once the evidence was revealed, the Islamist group involved claimed it had been a mistake, alleging they believed the boy was a soldier. Do you consider this explanation acceptable, given continued US support for these rebels?</b>

Even if that child had, in fact, been working for the regime, executing him in such a manner is absolutely unacceptable — it is a crime. At the very least, we must remain faithful to our fundamental principles: we do not execute children. Moreover, he was executed without any evidence, and in the most barbaric fashion—by having his throat slit. That, to me, constitutes a double crime. We must not negotiate with such people. The only appropriate response is to confront them—to eliminate them. There can be no dialogue with potential jihadists or with criminals.

The United States has shown, time and again, that it is willing to support even the most extremist Islamist factions. This is not new. The US has collaborated with Islamists in the past. These Islamists are devoid of principles; they are not seeking a genuine resolution to the Syrian conflict.

This stands in stark contrast to the many secular Syrians who still aspire to build a country that protects its citizens and its minorities. These people deserve protection—but sadly, it will not come through the United States. Each time the US intervenes in our region, it leaves behind chaos. Chaos is, ultimately, what serves its interests.

<b>After the Nice attack, François Hollande pledged to intensify the fight against Islamic State. A series of airstrikes followed in Manbij, including thirty reportedly mistaken strikes that hit predominantly civilian areas. Were these attacks a form of retaliation for the Nice attack?</b>

One must understand that, some time ago, clashes took place between Kurdish forces and Islamic State fighters in the area around Manbij. The Kurds enjoy the personal support of President Hollande, and that is what prompted him to order airstrikes on Manbij.

The aim was to assist the Kurds in capturing the city. It was not, in reality, a direct response to the Nice attack. In my view, the position of the French government is incredibly weak. Today, no one is even discussing the Islamist who carried out the Nice attack and was radicalised. Instead, we continue to hear claims that he was mentally disturbed—that he had no connection to Islam.

At some point, we must find the courage to speak plainly: yes, radical Islam exists; yes, Islam is in urgent need of reform; yes, the individual who committed the attack in Nice was radicalised and became a jihadist Islamist. We must adopt a far firmer stance. Otherwise, France will be struck again. Given the complacency of the French government, the Islamists will undoubtedly try once more.

<b>Why, then, bomb Syria if the perpetrator of the attack was radicalised in France and was physically present on French territory?</b>

The airstrikes launched after the attack were largely symbolic. The real motivation lies in the French president’s close relationship with the Kurds, who are fighting Islamic State on the ground in Syria. He simply seized a politically opportune moment to express that support through a French airstrike on Manbij.
