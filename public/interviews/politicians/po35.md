<b>Summary:</b>

During a live interview from Sochi at the Syrian National Dialogue Congress, Randa Kassis, President of the Astana Platform, offered detailed insights into the internal dynamics of the conference and the broader challenges facing the Syrian political process.

Kassis began by describing the atmosphere within the main hall, noting that although a variety of Syrian voices were present, the balance was skewed due to the large number of attendees from government-held areas. While some of these individuals represented religious communities, others adopted a confrontational stance, clinging to pre-2011 political narratives. She emphasised that this refusal to acknowledge the new reality on the ground hindered meaningful dialogue.

A central topic of discussion was the formation of a constitutional committee, which, according to Kassis, was being resisted by participants loyal to the regime. She expressed her firm opposition to limited reforms, advocating instead for the drafting of an entirely new constitution that reflects the fragmented state of Syria today, encompassing territories under self-administration, armed factions, and government control.

The Astana Platform’s constitutional proposal, Kassis explained, calls for a balanced distribution of powers between the presidency and parliament—modelled on the French system—while also preserving specific prerogatives for the Syrian army. She stressed that drafting a new constitution is the essential first step towards a political solution, and that without it, returning to Damascus or engaging in direct negotiations with the regime would be meaningless.

Kassis criticised both the Syrian regime and certain elements of the opposition for sharing the same authoritarian mindset and lack of pragmatism. She portrayed the Astana process as a more productive and tangible route than the Geneva process, which, in her view, had yielded little since 2014. She also blamed Western powers, including France and the United States, for undermining the Sochi and Astana efforts, insisting that their support for select opposition factions had become an obstacle to genuine progress.

Regarding the Kurdish issue and Turkey’s military operations in Afrin, Kassis adopted a balanced stance: she denounced any aggression against civilians but acknowledged Turkey’s security concerns.

On the question of international dynamics, Kassis argued that American influence in Syria had diminished, with Washington’s strategic focus shifting towards Asia. She expressed confidence in Russia’s pivotal role and asserted that if a political solution were firmly imposed, Western powers would eventually be compelled to accept and legitimise it, regardless of their initial objections.

In conclusion, Kassis reaffirmed her belief that the drafting of a new constitution must precede any broader settlement, and that time should not be wasted on reverting to outdated formats. For her, realism and inclusivity are the only viable paths towards a lasting solution for Syria.
