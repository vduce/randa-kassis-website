<b>Summary:</b>

In 2013, amid heightened international tensions following the alleged chemical attacks in Syria’s Ghouta region, the French television programme Ce soir (ou jamais !), hosted by Frédéric Taddeï, convened a diverse panel of intellectuals, political analysts, and public figures to debate a pressing question: Should the West intervene in Syria?

The discussion revealed profound divisions over the legitimacy, consequences, and moral implications of military intervention. Advocates of intervention argued that the use of chemical weapons constituted a crime against humanity demanding a firm international response. They cited a moral imperative to uphold international norms, protect civilian populations, and preserve the West’s credibility as a guarantor of human rights and the rule of law. Some proposed that limited, targeted strikes could serve as strategic leverage to pressure the Assad regime towards political negotiations—rather than pursuing outright regime change.

Opponents, however, expressed serious doubts regarding the reliability of the evidence implicating the regime, pointing to historical precedents—most notably the manipulation of intelligence in the lead-up to the Iraq War. They warned that military action could escalate an already volatile conflict, strengthen Islamist factions within the opposition, and deepen regional instability. Many also underscored the illegality of any intervention conducted without a United Nations Security Council mandate, and questioned whether past Western interventions had ever delivered on promises of peace or democracy.

Amid this polarised exchange, Randa Kassis stood out for her nuanced and pragmatic stance. While unequivocally opposed to the Assad regime, she also challenged the idealised portrayal of the Syrian opposition frequently seen in Western media. Kassis warned that much of the opposition was fragmented, heavily infiltrated by Islamist extremists, and far from unified around democratic principles. Instead of military backing for one side, she called for a realistic and inclusive political solution—grounded in negotiated transition and regional engagement.

The debate broadened to include wider geopolitical and historical dimensions, acknowledging Syria’s complex sectarian fabric, the regional rivalries exacerbating the conflict, and the limitations of international institutions such as the UN and the International Criminal Court. The influence of public opinion and the media’s role in shaping perceptions of intervention were also discussed, with several participants cautioning against reductive narratives and emotional manipulation.

No clear consensus emerged by the end of the programme. Instead, the discussion highlighted the enduring tension between moral urgency and strategic restraint—the imperative to act weighed against the risks of acting unwisely. It underscored the formidable challenge of formulating a coherent foreign policy in the face of humanitarian catastrophe, particularly in a conflict as multilayered and opaque as Syria’s.
