<b>Last week, Bashar al-Assad stated in Paris Match that since the beginning of the war in Syria, he has 'never stopped defending the people against the "terrorists"'. Do you believe him?</b>

The regime has always relied on that excuse. Tragically, what was false yesterday has become true today. Bashar al-Assad clearly bears part of the responsibility. He knows the region, the society, the spheres of influence. He knows who is capable of funding radical movements. And he allowed them to exploit a fertile ground of extremism.

<b>He continues to accuse Turkey.</b>

Yes, even when there was little justification, he made those accusations. But today, he is right. Having failed to impose the Muslim Brotherhood in Syria, Erdoğan sought revenge. He allowed jihadists to move in and out of Syria with impunity. As revealed by the German broadcaster ARD, there were even Daesh training camps in Gaziantep, Turkey.

<b>As Assad now implies, have we reached a point where dialogue with him is necessary?</b>

Unfortunately, yes. On the ground, the regime is no longer our only enemy; we are now facing Daesh, al-Nusra, and Khorasan. Our Kurdish allies are not equipped to defeat them alone. The regime cannot be considered an ally—but we must apply pressure to compel it into a political process. And that, inevitably, requires dialogue.

<b>Can the Syrian people forget the massacres committed by the regime?</b>

It is not a question of forgetting. The people are suffering—and they want peace. The time has come to work towards reconciliation, in order to begin rebuilding.
