**Randa Kassis, a Secular Voice in the Syrian Opposition** _La Croix_ 16 January 2015 By Agnès Rotivel

For many years, Randa Kassis kept her distance from her homeland, Syria. Today, however, she is resolutely committed to participating in its rebirth.

Born in Damascus in 1970, she grew up in a family marked by deep ideological contrasts. Her father, a Greek Catholic, was a vocal opponent of the Assad regime. Her mother, a Greek Orthodox, came from a background that supported it.

Did this familial duality plant the seeds of her early detachment—and her staunch commitment to secularism?

In 1979, she joined her father in Algeria, where he had taken refuge from Syria’s repressive climate. A professor of psychology, he had fled the country as the Muslim Brotherhood attempted to seize power by force. Three years later, she returned to Damascus.

Until the age of seventeen, Kassis tried to lead what she describes as “a normal life,” steering clear of political involvement. She refused to join the Shabiba, the Ba’ath Party’s youth wing.

“I learnt to say no; I learnt to rebel,” she recalls. “But at the time, political life was a lost cause,” given the constant threats facing dissidents. Several of her father’s acquaintances were imprisoned.

Eventually, she left again—this time in search of herself. She travelled extensively, experimented with painting, and eventually settled in Stuttgart, Germany, before relocating to France, where her daughter was born in 1997. She trained in martial arts, particularly kickboxing—“a good way to gain self-control, to understand things, and to build self-confidence.” She also briefly studied at the Cours Florent, drawn by her love of theatre.

The political spark ignited in 2007, four years before the Arab Spring. Kassis had been closely following the debates and writings emerging on social media across the Arab world.

“I connected with groups of young people calling for freedom of expression and resisting the religious discourse suffocating Arab societies.”

She sensed a rising desire for change in Egypt and Tunisia. “In Syria, it was more serious because the society was more heterogeneous—and multiple regional actors were involved.”

Through her articles in the Arab press, she condemned the Islamic proselytism of Saudi Arabia and the Gulf emirates and expressed deep scepticism towards Turkey’s so-called “moderate Islam.” She later founded the Movement for a Pluralistic Society and helped establish the Association for the Protection of the Right to Freedom of Expression in the Arab World.

When civil war broke out, Kassis joined the Syrian National Council (SNC) as a representative of a secular coalition. In August 2012, she was excluded after denouncing the dominance of Islamist factions and the influence of their Gulf backers.

Since then, she has worked to amplify the voices of those seeking an alternative path. Together with political essayist Alexandre del Valle, she co-authored Le Chaos Syrien, a book calling for political dialogue, national reconciliation, protection of minorities, and resistance to what they describe as “green totalitarianism.”

As head of the Movement for a Pluralistic Society, she was invited—along with 27 other opposition figures—to attend a meeting in Moscow from 26 to 30 January, aimed at preparing the ground for a possible dialogue with the regime.

“Fifteen opposition members have accepted the invitation. But I don’t believe members of the Syrian National Coalition will attend,” she noted.

“The objective is modest,” she conceded, just hours before her departure. “Nothing will be resolved at this meeting. But the Russians have succeeded in bringing the Syrian regime to the table—that alone is a positive step. The value of this initiative lies in bringing the Syrian question back to the forefront—something the world seems to have forgotten.”

It has now been nearly four years since the conflict began. Randa Kassis remains convinced that the time has come for a political solution: “Because everything else has failed.”

**Her Inspiration: “My Father is Nietzsche”**

“I was already very rebellious as a teenager,” says Kassis, who believes she inherited this spirit from her father. “I admire Nietzsche—a philosopher who rejected all codes and rules.”

In the Middle East, she places her hopes in the power of minorities and their role in shaping society. A passionate student of anthropology, she refuses to align herself under any single banner.

“What interests me is changing the way people perceive things. That’s what led me to write. But writing alone is not enough—you need the power to enact real change. Being an independent woman helps; it gives you the freedom to push boundaries.”
