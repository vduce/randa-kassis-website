**Geneva Negotiations** _BBC Arabic,_ _The World This Evening_ 31 January 2016

**Summary:**

The discussion sheds light on the complexities of the Syrian opposition negotiations, shaped in particular by the presence of two distinct delegations: the secular democratic group led by Randa Kassis, and the Riyadh-backed opposition, which includes Islamist factions such as Jaysh al-Islam. This dual structure has contributed to confusion and fragmentation, with the talks widely perceived as indirect and protracted due to the absence of substantive dialogue between the parties.

Randa Kassis and her delegation underscore their commitment to a secular and inclusive vision for Syria, firmly rejecting the reductive label of “the Moscow delegation”. They emphasise the importance of incorporating the Kurdish political element—such as the Democratic Union Party and the Kurdish National Council—into any credible negotiation framework, as a reflection of Syria’s pluralistic character.

The discussion also addresses the persistent challenges surrounding the legitimacy and coordination of opposition representation, as well as the ambiguous role of the United Nations in facilitating and structuring the process. Disagreements over the negotiation agenda, ongoing difficulties in establishing communication with Damascus, and uncertainty regarding the potential withdrawal or continued involvement of figures such as Saleh Muslim and Haytham Manna further compound the fragility of the talks.

Nevertheless, Randa Kassis and her delegation reaffirm their long-term commitment to constructive dialogue and a peaceful resolution. They maintain that genuine inclusivity—particularly the representation of marginalised and minority voices—is essential to both the legitimacy and the effectiveness of the peace process.
