<h4>Who Will Lead Syria? Insights from Geneva’s Political Corridor</h4>

<b>Summary:</b>

In the corridors of the United Nations in Geneva, we approached journalists — both those aligned with the regime and those supporting the opposition — who have been following the Syrian negotiations over the past four years. We presented them with a selection of names from across the political spectrum, including the current Syrian President, Bashar al-Assad, and asked: Who do you see in the future of Syria?

Some journalists pointed to Bashar al-Assad as the most likely short-term president, citing his continued grip on power and the absence of a viable alternative. Others, however, suggested that his role might diminish over the course of a new term.

Bashar al-Jaafari was mentioned as a potential successor should Assad step aside, though several journalists questioned his capacity to unify the country, citing his combative diplomatic tone.

Nasr al-Hariri and Mohammad Alloush, both opposition figures, faced more direct criticism, with many considering them to have lost credibility or missed their political moment.

Abu Mohammad al-Julani was universally dismissed as a legitimate political actor.

Randa Kassis, the only woman among the figures discussed, was noted without the level of criticism directed at other opposition members. While not widely cited as a leading presidential contender, some journalists described her as a relevant and visible figure within the broader Syrian political landscape.

A number of journalists declined to comment, citing either institutional restrictions or personal discretion — reflecting the complexity and sensitivity that continue to define Syria’s political future.
