**Randa Kassis: Russia’s Efforts to Unite the Syrian Opposition** _Al Ghad TV_ 25 April 2016

**Summary:**

In this televised interview, Randa Kassis, co-president of the secular and democratic delegation to the Geneva peace talks, joins from Brussels to discuss recent developments in the Syrian opposition negotiations. She explains that Russia has consistently advocated for the inclusive representation of all Syrian opposition platforms since 2014 and the Geneva II conference, firmly opposing any monopolisation of the opposition delegation—particularly by the Riyadh platform.

Kassis affirms that Russia’s position remains unchanged: all opposition factions must be represented in order to reflect Syria’s social and political diversity. She stresses that previous failures, such as Geneva II, were largely the result of excluding certain groups. Through sustained efforts, her delegation—comprising the Moscow, Astana, and Cairo platforms—has succeeded in asserting its presence within the negotiation process.

While acknowledging that the formation of a single, unified delegation is a desirable goal, Kassis criticises certain regional powers for persistently supporting only the Riyadh platform, which she views as a key obstacle to progress. She proposes either a comprehensive merger of the various platforms or, at the very least, an agreement that would allow the opposition to present a joint political paper in response to that of the Syrian government.

Kassis warns that if opposition factions continue to exclude one another, a political settlement will inevitably be imposed from outside. She calls for the inclusion of pragmatic and politically committed opposition figures—those who believe in a negotiated solution, as opposed to those who persist in pursuing a military outcome.

Responding to accusations that her group is attempting to create divisions within the Riyadh delegation, Kassis firmly denies such claims. She confirms that communication is ongoing with several of its members who, like her, seek a peaceful resolution and recognise Russia’s central role in shaping any viable political outcome for Syria.

Commenting on the absence of the Cairo platform during a recent meeting with the Russian Foreign Minister, Kassis attributes it to logistical reasons rather than ideological disagreement. She underscores that, while differences do exist—particularly between the three platforms and the Riyadh group—dialogue remains not only possible but essential.

Kassis concludes by emphasising the importance of unity among the various opposition factions in order to initiate a credible political process and preserve what remains of Syria.
