**Randa Kassis on the Moscow Talks: A Step Towards Dialogue Amid Deep Divisions** _Al Arabiya – Nuqtat Nizam_ 03 April 2015 Presented by Hassan Muawad

**Summary:**

In this interview, Randa Kassis, head of the Syrian Pluralistic Society Movement, reflects on the significance of the Moscow talks between representatives of the Syrian opposition and the regime. She regards these meetings as a modest yet meaningful breakthrough—particularly for enabling direct communication without foreign intermediaries, a crucial step after years of entrenched hostility. While acknowledging that the talks are far from a final resolution, she describes them as part of a gradual dialogue process aimed at fostering mutual trust, with incremental outcomes—such as prisoner releases—signalling cautious progress.

Kassis raises concerns about the legitimacy of certain opposition figures involved, noting that invitations to Moscow were extended largely to individuals rather than to officially mandated representatives. She does not claim to speak for all Syrians, but rather for a political will seeking a peaceful solution. She also critiques established opposition bodies such as the Syrian Opposition Coalition, arguing that they lack grassroots support within Syria and wield limited political influence, relying predominantly on foreign backing.

The interview also addresses Russia’s dual role as both facilitator and stakeholder. Kassis questions Moscow’s neutrality, citing its political and military support for the Assad regime. However, she observes that Russia’s principal interest appears to lie in preserving state institutions, rather than defending Assad personally—leaving space for diplomatic manoeuvre. Still, she contrasts Russia’s dominant role in the Moscow talks with the multilateral framework of the Geneva process, suggesting that this difference shapes both the nature and the flexibility of each track.

Turning to Syria’s complex internal landscape, Kassis underscores the diversity of political allegiances, including among minorities who—despite past repression—now perceive the regime as a bulwark against Islamist extremism. Her movement seeks to unite secular minorities and progressive Sunnis around a common vision that transcends sectarian and ideological divides.

While she considers the Geneva process to have effectively collapsed, particularly since mid-2014, Kassis maintains that the Moscow talks are not intended to replace it, but to function as a parallel initiative grounded in present-day realities. She rejects comparisons to the Oslo Accords, noting that Syria’s situation—marked by profound societal fractures and foreign intervention—is fundamentally different.

Ultimately, she acknowledges the limitations of the Moscow talks, especially the low-level participation of regime representatives in the first round, but remains hopeful that future meetings will be marked by greater commitment. For Kassis, trust-building measures by the regime—such as humanitarian action and the release of detainees—are essential to advancing the process. Despite significant internal divisions and external obstacles, she expresses cautious optimism that ongoing dialogue, however imperfect, remains vital to forging a path towards peace.
