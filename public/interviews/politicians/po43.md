<b>Summary:</b>

Randa Kassis has voiced serious concerns over the ongoing Geneva negotiations led by UN Special Envoy Staffan de Mistura, warning that they are unlikely to yield any meaningful results.

In a strongly worded statement, Kassis criticised de Mistura for lacking a coherent strategy or methodology to resolve the Syrian conflict. She accused him of merely prolonging the process in order to extend his own mandate, noting that his three-year tenure has produced no tangible progress.

Kassis also expressed frustration at the exclusion of key Syrian figures and negotiation platforms from the talks, arguing that this undermines their legitimacy. Furthermore, she accused the envoy of disregarding UN Security Council Resolution 2254, which sets out the framework for a political settlement.

Drawing comparisons with the ineffectual outcomes of previous negotiations, including the Astana meetings, Kassis dismissed the current process as superficial—'all titles and statements' with no substance. 'He offers nothing to Syrians', she concluded, expressing deep disillusionment with the international community’s approach to peace efforts.
