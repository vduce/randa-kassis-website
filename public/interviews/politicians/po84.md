Guest: Randa Kassis

<b>Summary:</b>

The interview with Randa Kassis, politician and President of the Movement for a Pluralistic Society, offers a nuanced and critical assessment of Syria’s fragmented opposition and the broader dynamics of the ongoing conflict. Kassis characterises her shifting affiliations within the opposition as pragmatic responses to the country’s fluid and unstable political landscape. She underscores the deep divisions among opposition factions, attributing their disunity to unrealistic foreign expectations, internal rivalries, and entrenched cultural mindsets resistant to compromise.

Kassis addresses the Islamisation of the uprising, identifying foreign funding—particularly from Qatar and Saudi Arabia—alongside conservative societal structures, as key factors driving this shift. She draws a clear distinction between Syria’s Muslim identity and the political project of Islamism, emphasising that Syria’s multi-ethnic and multi-religious composition precludes any viable transformation into an Islamic state.

Highlighting the absence of a cohesive national identity, Kassis laments the growing entrenchment of sectarian and ethnic loyalties. She insists that any enduring political solution must involve the Alawite community and take account of Syria’s complex societal fabric. She critiques binary sectarian narratives and calls instead for inclusive political programmes that genuinely reflect the pluralism of Syrian society.

Rejecting preconditions such as regime change prior to dialogue, Kassis argues that such demands are detached from reality, particularly in light of the regime’s military resilience. She defends the Geneva II talks as an essential—if arduous—opportunity for progress, and criticises those within the opposition who obstruct negotiations for ideological or personal gain.

On the question of human rights, Kassis is unequivocal: all parties to the conflict have committed serious violations, including torture and targeted violence against minority groups such as Christians, Alawites, and Druze. She calls for universal accountability, condemning the opposition’s selective silence on such abuses. In her view, moral credibility cannot be upheld through partial indignation.

Turning to the issue of societal reform, Kassis advocates for women’s rights and confronts deep-rooted patriarchal norms. She clarifies that her controversial remarks—such as proposing a “national day to break the hymen”—were intended as metaphorical appeals for female emancipation, though frequently misunderstood in a cultural context steeped in taboos.

Finally, Kassis calls for renewed and constructive international engagement—particularly from Russia—in advancing peace efforts. She warns that failure to seize diplomatic opportunities will only prolong the conflict, deepen human suffering, and further fragment all sides. Any future settlement, she insists, must reflect Syria’s demographic complexity through inclusive, representative, and sustainable political structures.
