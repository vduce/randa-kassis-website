**The Major Problem Is Trust: It No Longer Exists Between Syria’s Communities** _L’Hémicycle_  11 February 2014 By Thomas Renou

Randa Kassis was once a member of the Syrian National Council (SNC). After being excluded, she founded the Movement for a Pluralistic Society, a platform that brings together Syria’s minorities—Christians, Kurds, Alawites, secularists—as well as members of the Sunni majority. A secularist herself, from a Christian family, she has consistently campaigned against the establishment of an Islamic state in Syria.

**Can you first remind us why you were excluded from the SNC?**

I was excluded after warning the international community about the rise of fundamentalist Islamism in Syria. I stated clearly that a group close to Al-Qaeda had infiltrated the country. I was accused of playing into Bashar al-Assad’s narrative, as though I were discrediting the rebellion—but I was simply telling the truth. I knew that Assad had created a favourable environment for these jihadists. They weren’t there at the beginning of the uprising.

Some within the SNC refused to acknowledge this reality, just as they refused to recognise the abuses committed by brigades of the Free Syrian Army (FSA). I was criticised, threatened, and ultimately excluded from the Council.

**Today, you challenge the legitimacy of that coalition…**

It has no real influence on the ground. There are currently three distinct zones in Syria: an autonomous Kurdish region, a regime-controlled area, and a region under the control of Islamist forces.

**You make no distinction between moderate Islamism and jihadism?**

No. I do not believe in “moderate” Islamism. There is only one form of Islamism: one that seeks to establish an Islamic state.

**Yet didn’t a coalition of FSA units, the Islamic Front (the largest rebel group), and the Al-Nusra Front take action against ISIL?**

The Islamic Front chose to cooperate with ISIL. I don’t believe Al-Nusra or ISIL are being fought for patriotic reasons—it’s a battle for territory, for power. Let’s be clear: the Free Syrian Army no longer exists. I don’t believe the Islamic Front truly sees ISIL as an enemy. They share the same objective: the creation of an Islamic state and the implementation of sharia law.

Whether “moderate” or radical, these Islamists are not fighting for the freedom of the Syrian people. Every day, I witness the hatred some Sunnis express towards Shias, Alawites, Druze, Kurds, or Christians. I cannot excuse that just because we have a common enemy in Bashar al-Assad. I will never support the imposition of sharia—it negates democracy and denies individual freedoms. In Syria, 35% of the population are minorities who will never accept an Islamic state. Between the Islamic Front and the jihadists, only the methods differ.

**You argue that there has never been real dialogue between Sunnis and minorities, and that Syrian unity is a myth. Why?**

Where is the unity in Syria? I know that 10 to 15% of Sunnis are secular, but they can do little against those who want an Islamic state—unless they are willing to risk persecution. Identity in Syria today is primarily religious. So how can we agree on a political project?

There’s a wide gap between aspiration and reality. National unity will take generations to build—this is a question of education and cultural transformation. Only then can we speak of revolution. Until then, we must stop chasing after empty words and focus on what can be done concretely for Syria’s future.

**You’ve said the Alawites will never accept losing absolute power, and the Sunnis will never share it if they gain it. So how can peace be achieved?**

The greatest obstacle is trust—it simply does not exist between communities in Syria. If you ask the Alawites to surrender power and be ruled by Sunnis backed by Saudi Arabia and Qatar, they will naturally refuse. Why would they relinquish control? They will fight to the end.

That said, it is possible to persuade them to share power gradually. I believe in incremental change, not in sudden, radical transformation.

**And you advocate for a federal Syria…**

Yes, federalism is the best solution. It can bring communities together and allow the emergence of a shared national identity. At the start of the uprising, it truly was a struggle between a repressive regime and a people yearning for freedom. But that is no longer the case—now we hear calls for jihad and declarations from some Sunnis who want to exterminate every last Alawite and Christian.

**You support the Geneva peace process. Do you believe it can yield a solution?**

Yes, I support this political process. It places pressure on the regime and forces it to make concessions—such as agreeing to humanitarian corridors in besieged cities. I was horrified to see members of the coalition oppose this, simply to prevent the people of Homs from escaping a living hell. That is inhuman.

Meanwhile, the regime is regaining ground. It has reached compromises with certain rebel factions and is steadily dividing the opposition coalition.

**Do you see any hope of unity within the coalition?**

No. The only thing they have in common is that they are all funded by Saudi Arabia and Qatar.

**By royal decree, King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia has introduced harsh penalties for any Saudi who joins or supports extremist organisations. Do you believe this is genuine—or merely a smokescreen?**

It may be genuine. But will he succeed? If I may be a little cynical, I would say that only the destabilisation of Saudi Arabia will bring real change.

**It has become increasingly difficult for journalists to report from Syria. How do you stay informed?**

I remain in contact with many local committees operating in rebel-held territories. I also speak with Alawite opposition figures. I even have sources within the regime—people who are absolutely opposed to Assad’s policies.

**There are Alawites who want Assad gone?**

Yes. They tell me they are not fighting for Assad—it is an existential battle. And when people feel their very existence is threatened, rational thinking disappears. They are willing to do anything.
