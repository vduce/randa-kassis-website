<h4>Syria: Should We Intervene?</h4>

France 2 – Mots Croisés  
10 June 2013  
Presented by Yves Calvi  
Guests: Hubert Védrin, Natalie Nougayrèd, Pierre Lellouche, Randa Kassis & Rony Brauman  

<b>Summary:</b>

The debate centres on the escalating humanitarian catastrophe of the Syrian civil war, with a particular focus on the international community’s response to the confirmed use of chemical weapons by the Assad regime. Investigative journalism has provided substantial evidence, calling into question the credibility of Western 'red line' warnings and raising concerns that continued inaction could undermine international norms and accountability.

Opinions diverge sharply on the issue of military intervention. Some participants argue that limited air strikes or the provision of arms to rebel forces are essential to prevent further atrocities and to uphold the principles of international law and global order. Others, including Syrian dissident Randa Kassis, firmly oppose the arming of the rebels. She warns that such actions risk intensifying sectarian violence and emboldening Islamist factions within an already fragmented opposition. Kassis underscores the lack of cohesion and leadership among the opposition groups, stressing the real danger of aggravating a Sunni–Shia conflict that could spiral into broader regional instability.

Kassis instead advocates a political solution that incorporates all components of Syrian society, including secular forces and minority communities. She supports a decentralised model of governance as the most viable way to accommodate Syria’s diverse ethno-religious composition and to safeguard vulnerable groups such as the Alawites and Kurds. Furthermore, she emphasises the geopolitical risks of transforming Syria into a proxy battleground for competing powers—namely Iran, Russia, the Gulf States, and Western nations.

Other panellists echo concerns about the dangers of uncontrolled arms flows, drawing parallels with the aftermath of the intervention in Libya. The debate also touches on wider regional issues, including Iran’s nuclear ambitions, the risk of nuclear proliferation, and the long-term threat posed by jihadist fighters returning to Europe from the Syrian front.

The discussion brings to light the inadequacies of both military and current diplomatic approaches. The Geneva II peace initiative, while a step forward, remains impeded by internal opposition divisions and entrenched geopolitical rivalries.

In conclusion, Kassis and others call for a more pragmatic and inclusive diplomatic strategy—one that moves beyond simplistic binaries of 'regime versus opposition' and engages with the full complexity of Syrian society. The debate ultimately reveals the depth of the policy fractures in international responses to the conflict and the urgent need for a political process capable of addressing both humanitarian imperatives and long-term regional stability.
