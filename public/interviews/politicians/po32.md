**The Grand Interview: Randa Kassis** _RT France_ 13 April 2018 By Magalie Forestie

**Summary:**

In this episode of The Grand Interview, Franco-Syrian political figure Randa Kassis discusses her book Syria and the Return of Russia, offering a sober assessment of Russia’s evolving role in the Syrian conflict and the persistent failures of Western policy. A secular opponent of Bashar al-Assad and president of the Astana Platform, Kassis advocates a negotiated and inclusive political settlement rooted in Syrian sovereignty rather than dictated by foreign powers.

She recalls that Russia’s engagement in Syria predated 2013, but it was the threat of Western airstrikes following the Ghouta chemical attacks that prompted Moscow to intervene diplomatically—overseeing the dismantling of Syria’s chemical arsenal and averting a military escalation that many feared would replicate the disastrous intervention in Iraq. For Kassis, most rational opposition figures rejected the prospect of foreign strikes, recognising the potential for widespread collapse and regional destabilisation.

Russia’s direct military intervention in 2015, at the request of the Syrian regime, marked a significant turning point. While acknowledging the geopolitical motives underpinning Moscow’s actions, Kassis frames this move as a response to unchecked American influence near Russia’s borders and a strategic effort to reassert itself in a region saturated with Gulf-backed interests. She argues that Moscow sought to contain American power in a strategically sensitive area bordering the Caucasus and the Black Sea, particularly in light of Washington’s alliances in the Gulf. However, she does not portray this as a moral endorsement, but rather as a reflection of the multipolar reality that Western actors often resist.

Kassis highlights the effectiveness of Russian efforts against the Islamic State, noting that the intervention helped reclaim key territories. She views Russia’s growing role not as a threat, but as a potentially stabilising force capable of facilitating political transition—provided international actors abandon maximalist preconditions and instead focus on constitutional reform. While she supports Assad’s eventual departure, she insists that such a step cannot be imposed as a prerequisite for negotiations. Any meaningful peace, she argues, must involve the drafting of a new constitution and the establishment of a power-sharing government that reflects Syria’s ethnic, religious, and ideological diversity.

Drawing on her own experience within the Syrian National Council, Kassis criticises the Western tendency to back a narrow and often unrepresentative opposition, dominated by Islamist factions and reliant on foreign support. She contends that such groups are neither independent nor strategically credible, and that continued backing only prolongs the conflict while undermining legitimate, secular opposition forces.

Rejecting the illusion of a unified opposition, Kassis instead calls for the preservation of the political pluralism inherent in Syrian society. She regards the Astana Platform and the Sochi Conference as attempts to advance a more grounded and inclusive opposition—one willing to negotiate and capable of contributing to a constitutional framework conducive to long-term peace.

In conclusion, Kassis contends that lasting stability will not be achieved through external pressure or ideological rigidity, but through pragmatic compromise among Syrians themselves. For this to occur, Western powers must move beyond their reliance on weak proxies and engage with the full spectrum of Syrian political realities—even when those realities challenge prevailing narratives.
