<b>Summary:</b>

Four years into the Syrian conflict, over 200,000 people have been killed and some four million have fled the country as refugees. Syria’s economy lies in ruins, while President Bashar al-Assad continues to control approximately 40% of the territory—home to 60% of the population. Against this backdrop, Randa Kassis discusses Le Chaos Syrien, a book she co-authored with Alexandre Del Valle. The volume offers a historical and geopolitical analysis of the crisis and explores potential pathways toward resolution.

Kassis highlights the West’s failure to anticipate the jihadist threat, criticising France and other Western nations for their support of so-called 'moderate Islamists'. She argues that the Assad regime remains a political reality and must be included in any future national reconciliation process. In her view, the fight against Daesh (ISIS) must now take precedence, as secular and minority communities in Syria are most vulnerable to radical Islamist forces.

She maintains that political dialogue—already initiated in Moscow without Western participation—must proceed without preconditions. Only a gradual and pragmatic approach, she asserts, involving both the regime and reasonable opposition figures—not proxies of Turkey or the Gulf monarchies—can lay the foundations for reconciliation.

Kassis also underscores the necessity of including Syria’s allies—particularly Russia and, in due course, Iran—while noting Moscow’s reservations about Tehran’s military involvement. For any lasting solution, she concludes, Western powers must acknowledge their past miscalculations and support a step-by-step transition that incorporates actors such as the Free Syrian Army and Kurdish forces engaged in the struggle against jihadism.
