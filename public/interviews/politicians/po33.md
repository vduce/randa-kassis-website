To shed light on the latest developments in Syria, Alexandre del Valle met with Randa Kassis, the Syrian politician who has been at the forefront of the country’s political transition and who recently participated in the Sochi summit on Syria, organised by Russia. This week, she is publishing a major testimonial work entitled Russia’s Return to Syria (Éditions des Syrtes), which offers a comprehensive assessment of the situation in Syria and the broader region, eight years after the onset of the Arab Spring—a movement that, incidentally, quickly descended into an “Islamist winter”.

However, following the swift and devastating military advances of Daesh (2014–2015), a new balance of power has emerged in Syria since the victory of Russian forces, the Damascus regime, and their Iranian-backed Shia allies over the Islamic State and other jihadist groups. According to Randa Kassis, this victory—now being consolidated through efforts to liberate Eastern Ghouta from Islamist rebels and jihadists—has created the necessary conditions to initiate the political phase of resolving the Syrian conflict.

For Kassis, this political solution took concrete shape in particular at the Sochi summit, organised by Russia in coordination with its Turkish and Iranian partners, with the aim of bringing all parties to the conflict to the same table—something the West neither succeeded in doing nor genuinely attempted. As early as 2017, the “Astana Platform”, chaired by Randa Kassis, had already begun drafting a constitutional proposal aimed at redefining intercommunal relations and shaping the future regime on the basis of mutual guarantees. These efforts were recently strengthened in Sochi.

A compelling testimony from an exceptional political figure—one who speaks without resorting to empty rhetoric.

<b>Madame Randa Kassis, you participated in the Sochi negotiations organised by Russia last month, which sought to explore avenues for a political transition in Syria. In your book, you reference this event and express considerable hope in its potential. In your view, why is Russia an indispensable actor in any resolution to the Syrian crisis?</b>

It is evident to any lucid observer that no political solution in Syria is possible without Russia—whether one likes it or not, and regardless of whether one is “pro” or “anti-Russian,” which is not the core issue here. This is simply a geopolitical fact and a matter of strategic realism. Unfortunately, despite the undeniable nature of this reality—given the balance of power on the Syrian battlefield and recent developments in the war—many countries, particularly in the West, continue to operate within a Cold War mindset, systematically excluding Russia and its proposals on principle, even when those proposals are constructive and could open significant pathways to peace and de-escalation.

Due to this entrenched anti-Russian bias, most Western politicians and media figures deny the fact that Moscow is actively seeking collaboration with international institutions, such as the UN, in order to pursue a peaceful transition and bring an end—swiftly if possible—to this devastating conflict, whose primary victims remain civilians. As I have explained in my speeches and most recent book, I deeply regret that Western nations bear significant responsibility for prolonging the war in Syria, largely due to their obstinate refusal to cooperate with Moscow and their rejection of efforts to build consensus with Russia and other major regional actors—consensus being essential for any viable political solution.

<b>In what way has Russia, despite its support for the Damascus regime, done more to advance peace in Syria than the West?</b>

We often overlook the fact that Russia is the only balancing force in this conflict—locally, regionally, and internationally. As a Syrian who is striving to find a peaceful resolution without siding either with Bashar al-Assad’s regime or the Islamist rebels—and instead attempting to reconcile Syrians of all backgrounds, ethnicities, and faiths—I can state unequivocally that we need Russia. Unlike France, the Europeans, the Turks, and other actors with colonial or imperialist legacies, Russia has no colonial past in Syria. And unlike the United States, which refuses to accept any solution that does not conform to its own strategic preferences, Russia listens to all parties and adopts a pragmatic, dispassionate approach.

The role played by the United States and Western countries more broadly—who, from the beginning of the crisis, supported Islamist rebels and at times even jihadist factions linked to al-Qaeda—has not brought Syria closer to peace. Quite the contrary: it has significantly prolonged the conflict, particularly by insisting on unrealistic preconditions such as the immediate departure of Bashar al-Assad and by rejecting Russia’s proposals in favour of radical Sunni Islamist powers such as Saudi Arabia and Qatar.

Western countries continue to pursue this misguided course, with diplomats themselves undermining negotiations by maintaining a principled hostility towards Russia and its inclusive, pragmatic proposals. These proposals, in my view, are indispensable, as Russia is the only actor capable of engaging with all sides—from the rebels to the Damascus regime, the Kurds, the Iranians, Hezbollah, the Israelis, the Sunni powers, and the West. For this reason alone, no resolution is possible today without Russia, a country that, since 2015, has reasserted its presence in the Middle East, as I discuss in my book. Russia is the only power capable of balancing the many conflicting local and regional forces.

Take, for example, the escalating hostility between Iran and Saudi Arabia: only Russia is currently able to engage in dialogue with both and act as a counterweight between these two major poles of regional Islam, locked in a kind of Sunni–Shia civil war. Rather than viewing Russia as a destabilising force, Western nations would do well to recognise that Moscow can contribute to stabilising not only the Middle East but the broader global order, as it promotes a multipolar world. But for this to happen, Western strategic thinking must move beyond Cold War paradigms.

<b>In recent days, there has been much discussion about the humanitarian crisis in Ghouta. Western media, the United States, and the European Union have implied that Russia has not done enough to pressure the Damascus regime, which is accused of massacring civilians in this area with Moscow’s backing. What is your response?</b>

Let us first recall that last Saturday, the UN Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution—without a Russian veto—calling for a ceasefire in Eastern Ghouta, an area to the east of Damascus. This resolution came as pro-regime forces were advancing into this strategic stronghold of jihadist and radical Islamist rebels. Russia subsequently proposed a “humanitarian pause” to allow civilians to leave the rebel-held enclave, but this initiative failed. Nevertheless, the Western press placed blame squarely on the Damascus regime and Russia (along with Iran and its Shiite allies) for the humanitarian disaster in Ghouta.

In response, it was argued that Islamist rebels and their jihadist allies were in fact the ones preventing civilian evacuation by shelling the corridor intended for this purpose. The principal groups operating in Ghouta include Jaysh al-Islam (“Army of Islam”), a Salafist faction supported by Saudi Arabia, and Faylaq al-Rahman (“Legion of the Most Merciful”), which is based in western Ghouta and affiliated with the Free Syrian Army. The latter is backed by Turkey and Qatar and remains closely aligned with the Muslim Brotherhood.

After earlier clashes, Jaysh al-Islam and Faylaq al-Rahman have now entered into an alliance. Jaysh al-Islam commands roughly 10,000 fighters, while Faylaq al-Rahman numbers around 8,000. Alongside them are smaller jihadist elements, such as the Al-Zinki group, which is supported by Turkey and the United States. These radical Islamist rebels have indeed used civilians as human shields.

To hold Russia responsible for the bloodshed in Ghouta, or to claim it has failed to pressure the regime, is, in my opinion, deeply unjust. Those levelling such accusations are unwilling to demand accountability from the Islamist rebels, who for years have been encouraged—implicitly or explicitly—by Western support for their cause. That support, often uncritical and ideologically driven, has taken the form of backing an “opposition” composed largely of Islamist factions and even jihadist groups.

Ultimately, the critics of Russia seek one outcome only: that Moscow submit to their dictates and accept, unconditionally, their unrealistic prescriptions. One must not forget that the West has consistently supported an Islamist opposition that is at least as ideologically rigid as the regime in Damascus. These groups are now represented in the Syrian Negotiation Commission (formerly the High Negotiations Committee), which is dominated by the Muslim Brotherhood, Salafists, and other Islamists closely tied to Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Turkey.
