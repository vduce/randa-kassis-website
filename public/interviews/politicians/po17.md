Randa Kassis, a Franco-Syrian politician and president of the Movement for a Pluralistic Society, served as co-chair of the Syrian secular and democratic opposition delegation at the Geneva peace talks. In 2015, she launched the Astana Platform, which has since brought together various Syrian opposition figures on multiple occasions.

Randa Kassis, President of the Movement for a Pluralistic Society, Syrian opposition figure, anthropologist, and author of a widely recognised book on Russia’s role in the Middle East\*, is a noted expert and practitioner in Russian foreign policy. Since 2013, she has participated in numerous negotiation rounds—in Geneva, Sochi, Astana, and Istanbul—as President of the Astana Platform. Through this work, she has engaged extensively with Russian diplomats and military officials, whose methods she understands intimately and whose resolve she neither underestimates nor takes lightly.

It is for this reason that she does not share the optimism of certain Western leaders who, in recent weeks, have imagined the Russian army becoming bogged down in Ukraine or, as the Biden Administration appears to hope, the eventual downfall of Vladimir Putin. She cautions that sanctions have proven largely ineffective, that Russia is far from isolated outside the Western sphere, and that any credible successor to Putin would likely be even more hardline than the current master of the Kremlin.

Kassis foresees a protracted conflict, warns of genuine risks of escalation into a broader European—or even global—conflagration, and believes that the West, particularly the United States and the United Kingdom, bears a measure of responsibility for the deeper antagonism at play around Ukraine. At its core, she sees the war as a proxy confrontation between the Atlantic-Western bloc and the emerging multipolar, non-Western world.

Russia, for its part, regards itself as the spearhead of this multipolar world, actively challenging the international order imposed by the Anglo-Saxon powers in the aftermath of the Second World War, and especially since the end of the Cold War.

Randa Kassis’s track record in parallel diplomacy, combined with her political and intellectual standing, extends far beyond the Syrian context. In addition to her long-standing advocacy for minorities across the Arab world and for women’s rights, her initiatives and writings have, at times, influenced both Russian diplomacy and the United Nations—most notably in the context of the Astana talks, which, for the first time, succeeded in bringing all Syrian factions to the same negotiating table without exclusion.

Disillusioned by the short-sightedness and lack of strategic vision displayed by Western powers, and strongly critical of Islamist forces as well as Erdoğan’s Turkey, Randa Kassis remains firmly committed to advancing a draft for a new Syrian constitution. She views this as essential to restoring pluralism through a progressive and inclusive process of democratisation. While firmly convinced that the continued rule of Bashar al-Assad constitutes a fundamental obstacle, she avoids the common error—frequently made by many opposition figures—of insisting upon his departure as a rigid and counterproductive precondition.

As early as 2017, even before the United Nations formally addressed the issue, she had already underscored the importance of establishing a constitutional committee as a means of facilitating the peace process. Determined to pursue the struggle, Randa Kassis—who is also the co-founder of the AD-HOC Foundation, based in London and uniting secular activists and Muslim intellectuals from across the globe, including the renowned poet Adonis, the thinker Sayyed Al-Qimni, the secular essayist Waleed Al-Husseini, and Kacem El-Ghazali—has chosen to speak with candour and uncompromising realism about what she terms the “Ukrainian chaos,” which she regards as the successor to the protracted “Syrian chaos”.

This is the essential testimony of a leading expert and practitioner of Russian foreign policy—an area still poorly understood in the West and within the French media.

<b>Do you believe that the negotiations initiated in Turkey or elsewhere between the Ukrainians and the Russians have reached an impasse, particularly in light of the battle for Donetsk – the largest military engagement in Europe since 1945 – and Russia’s evolving war objectives in Ukraine?</b>

The situation extends well beyond the Donetsk region. According to the most recent statements from the Russian Ministry of Defence, one of the Kremlin’s strategic aims is to capture Odessa, thereby securing full control over access to the Black Sea. I believe the Russian army will push at least as far as the city of Dnipro and will not hesitate to engage in a battle for the strategically significant city of Kharkiv – despite the fact that it has so far successfully resisted, with Russian forces having previously abandoned their efforts in the face of strong Ukrainian resistance. Russia’s ambitions therefore clearly surpass the Donetsk and Mariupol region – the latter having been under Russian control for the past two weeks – and it seems illusory at this point to expect any genuine negotiations, given that they serve neither the interests of the Ukrainian government nor those of the Russian leadership.

<b>Following António Guterres’ recent visit to Moscow and his futile attempts to sway Vladimir Putin, followed by his subsequent trip to Kyiv, what is your view of the role of the United Nations?</b>

First and foremost, we must place the United Nations’ involvement into perspective. It is an institution running on empty, mired in its own bureaucracy, and led by a Secretary-General devoid of both charisma and vision—António Guterres—who appears to act more as a bankruptcy trustee than as a genuine leader.

<b>In the Western press, it is common to hear and read analyses by specialists, journalists, and politicians suggesting that Ukraine will become a “graveyard” or an “Afghanistan” for the Russians—that they will become bogged down and ultimately suffer defeat. Some even begin to entertain the notion of a Ukrainian military victory over a depleted and demoralised Russian army. What is your assessment?</b>

I believe the West is confusing its aspirations with reality… My experience of the Syrian civil war and of negotiations with the Russians has taught me to remain cautious in the face of Western media propaganda, which at times rivals that of the Russians. I recall that between 2013 and 2018—prior to the near-total defeat of the Islamists, al-Qaeda, and ISIS in Syria, with the exception of the north-western pocket of Idlib—Western commentators were already claiming that Russia was bogged down in Syria, that it was a “total failure”, their “grave”, their “Vietnam”… Yet we saw how things turned out: the Russians often make mistakes, they are not particularly strong in logistics, but they are tenacious and do not abandon their objectives. They take their time, retreat, then return; they carry out tactical withdrawals, leading their adversaries to believe they are pulling out, only to re-emerge stronger. The recent fall of Mariupol—which had already been taken and lost in 2014, then recaptured by them in 2022—reminds us that they are resilient, patient, and willing to pursue their military aims at any cost, as we saw in Aleppo, in Palmyra, and elsewhere in Syria. The West should therefore exercise caution before declaring victory—however desirable and commendable that outcome may be—because events do not always unfold according to one’s hopes. Unlike Western governments, the Russian leadership is not beholden to media-driven pressure, which enables it to pursue its military objectives over the long term.

<b>Has the isolation of Russia, as pursued by the United States, genuinely been achieved?</b>

Not in the slightest. Take the example of the G20, which increasingly reflects a multipolar world that is less Western-centric: Indonesia remains determined to invite Vladimir Putin to the G20 summit this November, and neither President Zelensky’s objections—he too has been invited—nor those of the United States have changed that. The United States seems to forget that it is no longer the centre of the world. The previous global order, divided into two blocs—the West and the Rest—is now obsolete. Many countries are now anti-Western, non-Western, or neutral/non-aligned, such as India or even Brazil—both of which are largely indifferent to the war in Ukraine and have refused to impose sanctions on Russia.

<b>Without downplaying the appalling Russian “special military operation” in Ukraine, are the Anglo-Saxon powers not exploiting the Russo-Western antagonism over Ukraine to weaken Europe—particularly given the risk that Europe, through a lasting alliance with Russia as Germany was pursuing via Nord Stream 2, might have become too powerful?</b>

Yes. With leaders as weak as Charles Michel, Ursula von der Leyen, and the German Chancellor Olaf Scholz—who resembles a frightened and abandoned child lost in a frenzied crowd—the European Union resembles a rudderless vessel captained by penguins adrift in stormy seas. Meanwhile, the United States, along with China and other powers, is reaping the benefits of the crisis. The United States is profiting in certain sectors—shale gas, arms sales, and the like—yet it is not immune to the crisis. Its economy had already contracted by 1.4% in the first quarter of 2022, and should the second quarter confirm a similar downturn, the country will be teetering on the brink of recession by year’s end. A decline from 5% growth the previous year to merely 1 or 2% represents a serious challenge for the United States, which requires a consistently higher growth rate than Europe’s to maintain the momentum of its economic engine.

Inflation is soaring across the board, particularly in the United States, and the process of de-dollarisation in commodity markets is already underway. Should this trend continue, it could trigger a significant shock to the American economy. The collapse of the “American dream” within a few years is no longer an implausible scenario. Yet it is Europe that is, for now, the greatest loser. The euro has recently been among the weakest-performing currencies; German growth is in steep decline, and the country faces the very real threat of recession if a full ban on Russian gas is imposed—something the business sector is ill-equipped to withstand.

<b>Much has been said about the impact of the war and the sanctions on the Russian economy, with forecasts suggesting an 8% decline in Russia’s GDP for 2022. What impact is the war likely to have on the European economy?</b>

The other side of the coin is indeed deeply problematic for European industry. We still do not know how we will replace Russian gas in the event of a total—or even gradual—ban, despite the Commission’s assurances that this will be offset by an “energy-saving plan”. European foundries and steelworks have already been forced to reduce their output, which is clearly detrimental to economic growth. Moreover, this will inevitably push inflation even higher.

We are told that cutting Russia off from the European oil market would cost Moscow €15 billion per month, but putting such measures into practice is far from straightforward. The transition periods demanded by dependent countries—such as Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, and Austria—will allow the Russians time to secure alternative markets.

And the ultimate irony: the West is cancelling existing contracts with Russia in favour of new agreements that Moscow can now sign in currencies other than the dollar. This will only accelerate the de-dollarisation of raw materials—bearing in mind that Russia holds the largest gas reserves in the world.

<b>You are well acquainted with Russian diplomats, having negotiated with them extensively. Do you believe the Russian leadership is prepared to endure months—or even years—under embargo and Western sanctions, entirely cut off from the West?</b>

Yes, they are prepared—perhaps surprisingly so. Within Russia, there exists a conservative and nationalist faction that is markedly more hardline than Vladimir Putin himself. I witnessed this first-hand during my discussions with Russian officials concerning Syria.

However, to place the extent of the sanctions into perspective—given that they are almost exclusively Western—it is important to note that Russia is by no means entirely isolated. Nearly half the world continues to maintain economic and diplomatic relations with Moscow.

<b>In your books—particularly The Syrian Chaos (2016, co-authored with your humble servant) and later The Return of Russia to the Middle East (2017)—you frequently discussed the significant divergences between the Russian Ministries of Defence and Foreign Affairs, as well as among the various clans and groups that influence President Putin. Does the same dynamic apply in the case of Ukraine?</b>

Divergences of opinion certainly persist, but in the current context, it is virtually impossible for a Russian Foreign Minister to make his voice heard. He would be regarded as a traitor. For instance, General Viktor Zolotov, who heads the National Guard, is more hardline than Vladimir Putin, while Nikolai Patrushev\*\*, Secretary of the Russian Security Council (SC), is even more nationalist. It is therefore highly unlikely that a “moderate” would replace Putin were he to be removed—say, in the (highly improbable) event of a total defeat of the Russian army in Ukraine, as President Biden might hope. Rather, figures such as Nikolai Patrushev would be the likely successors. It is thus deeply illusory to believe that Western powers might moderate the Kremlin’s position by applying pressure on the oligarchs, as these oligarchs are under strict surveillance—not by the FSB, as one might assume, but by a special unit led by Sergei Vakhrounov, Patrushev’s deputy within the Security Council. Even the various branches of the FSB are themselves monitored by the Council.

<b>In your view, how far does the Russian army intend to go? Does it truly possess the capacity to achieve its objectives? Are these objectives even attainable? Will the Russians ultimately withdraw?</b>

The objectives of the Russian army have clearly evolved since the outset of the war. Broadly speaking, however, they now appear to focus on controlling a line stretching from Kharkiv to Odessa, from east to west. Achieving this will take time. At this stage, Vladimir Putin cannot afford to retreat, and one can easily imagine the risks such a scenario would entail. Let us recall that the Russian army continues to gain ground in the East and South, and that some are perhaps too quick to speak of a Ukrainian victory…

Ukrainian soldiers in Donetsk are nearly encircled and are encountering serious difficulties in resupplying arms. The Ukrainian air force has been almost entirely destroyed. It is true that Poland has delivered six MiG-29s, but they are ageing aircraft, and Ukrainian pilots will not be capable of operating F-16s independently for several years. As a result, many American instructors are currently present on the ground in both Ukraine and Poland to provide training. However, the aircraft stationed in Poland by the United States and other “allies” are not easily transferable to Ukraine, as NATO seeks to avoid direct confrontation. Consequently, the weaponry arriving in western Ukraine faces considerable challenges in being transported. It is worth noting that the Russian army possesses the capacity to destroy all Ukrainian airports used for transporting Western arms—but has not yet taken that step. At present, vast arms stockpiles are blocked in the West. As a result, attacks on railway stations and lines have commenced and are likely to intensify.

The danger lies in the potential for further escalation if the Russian army is compelled to strike the Polish border region near Lviv in order to destroy incoming arms depots—thus increasing bombardments in western Ukraine. On the other side, the most significant and damaging military operations carried out by Ukraine against Russia are, in fact, directed by the United States… We are therefore edging ever closer to a full-scale “proxy war” between the United States and Russia.

<b>What parallels can be drawn with the Syrian crisis, which also saw Russia and the West on opposing sides, albeit indirectly?</b>

The two wars are fundamentally different. The current war in Ukraine was initiated by a neighbouring state—Russia—which invaded Ukraine for a range of reasons or pretexts. In response, the invaded country is now being heavily armed by the United States and almost all European nations. By contrast, the Syrian conflict began as a domestic uprising that was subsequently manipulated and supported by several regional powers—namely Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Turkey—as well as the United States. The military involvement of European countries was considerably less than in the present conflict. Moreover, the jihadist Islamist element present in Syria has no equivalent in the Ukrainian war.

The recent escalation raises concerns about far more serious consequences for Europe’s security. Most European leaders increasingly resemble sleepwalkers, no longer in control of events.

<b>Does your experience with Russian negotiators, diplomats, policymakers and military officials—both in diplomatic settings and on the ground in Syria—give you a particular perspective on the current situation?</b>

My experience in Syria, negotiating with various actors including the Russians, allows me to say that they are exceptionally resolute and patient. In Syria, for instance, they waited two years before launching the assault on Aleppo—from late 2014 to late 2016. During that time, they convened meetings, undertook repeated visits, and facilitated reconciliation efforts—all while hostilities continued. In Ukraine, they are likely to attempt to retake Odessa. They aim to control this port city in order to choke Kyiv by cutting off access to the sea. They will not retreat. They will continue advancing southwards and eastwards. They will even attempt to return to Kyiv if they can, with the goal of installing a pro-Russian government and neutralising Zelensky. In short, they will not back down.

This conflict will be prolonged—possibly for years. I have witnessed the modus operandi of Russian forces in Syria. The same individuals remain in charge today on the Ukrainian front as were in Syria. Accordingly, the same methods endure: Nikolai Patrushev still heads the Security Council, the then Minister of Defence, Sergei Shoigu, remains in office, and Viktor Zolotov continues to lead the National Guard. The same people will produce the same outcomes.

Even if Vladimir Putin were to be replaced—which I consider unlikely—the war aims in Ukraine would, in my view, remain unchanged, if not become even more severe. The Russians are prepared to stay for ten or twenty years if necessary. They largely disregard the sanctions, which we tend to overestimate. Back in 2014, we were already discussing Western sanctions with Russian officials—targeting companies and oligarchs—and our interlocutors told us they were indifferent. Even then, some Russian military figures were already saying that Europe, having “dared to do this,” deserved to be punished, even with a nuclear strike.

Based on personal experience and testimony, I can confirm that beyond Vladimir Putin—who, contrary to Western perception, is not the most radical figure in Moscow—there are truly dangerous individuals within the military and certain power circles in Russia. My Russian contacts often tell me they are “prepared for the worst,” whether that entails total sanctions, which they anticipated, or even a large-scale conflagration.

Personally, I fear certain figures in Russia who are indeed capable of anything… Fortunately, some of them are not in charge, as they could take things dangerously far. Western warmongers would do well to reflect on this before taking hasty and ill-considered decisions. It is essential that we engage in dialogue and put a stop to the arms race and political brinkmanship.

<b>What are the potential pathways out of this crisis? Are any diplomatic avenues still open?</b>

At present, I see very few… We are not truly in a phase of crisis resolution. The Russians’ priority is to secure the South and to bring down the government in Kyiv.

Let us recall that key figures such as General Zolotov, head of the National Guard, are even more nationalist and hardline than Putin. Were Putin to disappear, he would most likely be replaced by someone like Viktor Zolotov or Nikolai Patrushev, head of the Security Council—both of whom might not hesitate to strike Ukraine with even greater force. We must also recognise that the United Nations will struggle to play any significant role, given the divergent interests of the five permanent members of the Security Council, and the near-total absence of leadership from Secretary-General António Guterres, who increasingly resembles a naked Pope without a church.

Moreover, nearly all European countries are supplying Ukraine with heavy weaponry to varying degrees. Even traditionally neutral states such as Norway are now delivering arms—despite the fact that they might have played a role in facilitating peace talks between the various actors and belligerents.Turkey, for its part, initially took the lead in launching peace negotiations, but has since disqualified itself as a mediator by abandoning neutrality—most notably through the sale of drones to Ukraine and increasingly hostile rhetoric towards Russia.

Strictly speaking, only Switzerland remains in a position to act, by bringing the different stakeholders around the table.
