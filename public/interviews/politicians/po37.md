**TV Report and Interview** _Al Jadeed TV_ 29 November 2017 By Ramez al-Kadi

**Summary:**

The Syrian conflict had, by this stage, begun to mirror the trajectory of the Lebanese civil war, particularly in the sphere of political dialogue—recalling the diplomatic endeavours of Geneva and Lausanne, and culminating in the Saudi-American-Syrian Taif Agreement. Against this backdrop, the Sochi Conference emerged as a potentially decisive juncture in the consolidation of a political process, distinguished by its representative legitimacy and its prioritisation of constitutional reform as a cornerstone for a viable resolution.

In her interview, Randa Kassis accentuated the strategic significance of the Sochi Conference, portraying it as a critical inflection point in the Syrian peace process. She emphasised its inclusive character and its central focus on constitutional restructuring, presenting it as a more pragmatic and attainable framework for political settlement than the increasingly moribund Geneva initiative. Highlighting Russia’s commanding position—consolidated through its military ascendancy, the establishment of the Astana platform, and further buttressed by its regional entente with Turkey and Iran—Kassis contended that Moscow now possesses the principal levers necessary to steer Syria’s political future.

The conversation further examined the broader international context, in which the United States and France persist in championing the Geneva track, driven by Cold War-era strategic reflexes and apprehensions regarding Russia’s expanding influence. Kassis pointed to Washington’s reliance on its alliance with Kurdish forces as its principal means of maintaining a strategic foothold in northern Syria—and thereby securing a seat at the table in the post-conflict political configuration.

Throughout the interview, Kassis articulated a clear-eyed realpolitik perspective, advocating a pragmatic recognition of prevailing geopolitical realities rather than adherence to obsolete diplomatic formulas.
