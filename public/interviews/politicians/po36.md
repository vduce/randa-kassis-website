Randa Kassis, head of the Astana Platform, affirmed that a large number of groups had attended the Sochi Conference, emphasising that all participants had demonstrated a strong sense of national duty and responsibility towards Syria, as well as a sincere commitment to seeking a solution to the crisis.

Kassis, who also leads the Movement for a Pluralistic Society, remarked that those who refused to participate in the Syrian National Dialogue Congress in Sochi—and subsequently attacked the initiative—lacked any genuine sense of responsibility.

In an exclusive statement to Sputnik, Kassis explained that her delegation included representatives from the Astana Platform, the Movement for a Pluralistic Society, and several other groups, alongside influential Syrian figures from armed factions, the Union of Syrians Abroad, and prominent individuals formerly based in Eastern Ghouta.

<b>No Solution Under UN Auspices</b>

The head of the Astana Platform stressed that all participants understood that, regrettably, a solution to the Syrian crisis was no longer viable under United Nations auspices. 'The solution we seek', she said, 'can begin here in Sochi'.

Her comments came in response to a Sputnik reporter’s question regarding the controversy surrounding participation in Sochi and how the event should be understood politically and objectively.

When asked about the inclusion of representatives from armed groups within her delegation, and about what could realistically be expected from Sochi given the overlapping divisions within both the internal and external Syrian opposition, she replied:

'I believe we must persevere, and that all of us must work collectively to ensure Sochi’s success, despite the many difficulties faced by members of the Syrian opposition'.

<b>Our Responsibility to Syria – Its Homeland, Its History</b>

She added: 'Our responsibility today—towards Syria as a homeland, as a history, and as a future—requires that we set aside our differences and work together to ensure the success of this conference. It remains the only viable path forward for Syria'.

In response to a question concerning the working paper and political programme presented by the Astana Platform in Sochi, Kassis stated: 'We shall not leave Sochi without the formation of a Constitutional Committee. Once this committee is established, it must immediately begin drafting a new constitution for the country'.

She revealed: 'We spent an entire year in Astana working on a draft constitution, which we now have ready in hand'.

<b>A Proposed Model for the Syrian State</b>

Kassis elaborated: 'We believe the constitution must include practical mechanisms to facilitate a political solution. Let us acknowledge the reality in Syria: there are territories controlled by various actors—the Syrian state, the "Autonomous Administration", and certain armed factions. In light of this reality, how can we at least define a framework for a unified Syrian state? That is why we are proposing a model for the Syrian state within the constitution'.

<b>State Neutrality Towards Belief Systems</b>

She noted that discussions surrounding the draft had sparked intense debate between secular actors and others who rejected the term secularism in favour of civility.

'Frankly, I fail to understand what is meant by a "civil" state—except perhaps that it is non-military, which concerns more how individuals experience the state', she remarked.

'To address this issue', she continued, 'I proposed that secularism be articulated in the constitution through the concept of state neutrality towards belief systems. This neutrality should apply equally to all citizens, whether their convictions are religious or non-religious. After all, belief is not confined to religion—it encompasses freedom of thought and personal conscience more broadly'.

<b>A Fifth Option in Personal Status Law</b>

As for what matters most to the average Syrian citizen, Kassis pointed to the realm of personal status law, particularly in matters of marriage, divorce, and inheritance.

'To address this challenge', she said, 'I proposed the introduction of a fifth personal status category in the constitution, in addition to the four existing ones: Sunni, Druze, Orthodox, and Catholic'.

She continued: 'Why not add a "purely civil" category, entirely independent of religious authority? This would not impose any single model upon others, but at the very least, it would grant Syrian citizens the freedom to choose. In other words, those who wish to marry, divorce, or have their affairs governed by civil law—without recourse to any religious framework—would be free to do so under this fifth category'.

<b>Trust in President Putin’s Initiative</b>

Asked whether she viewed President Vladimir Putin’s role in initiating the Sochi process as cause for confidence in Russia’s political approach, Kassis responded:

'President Putin’s initiative is, in my view, an extremely important message—one that, sadly, not everyone has grasped. When President Putin takes the initiative, it signals not just intent, but also the political will to achieve a solution in Syria. That is why I have great confidence in this initiative, and precisely why we are here in Sochi'.

She added: 'I worked hard to bring together as many Syrian opposition figures as possible to form a working group and begin building a solution. But that process cannot start without the drafting of a new constitution'.

'We have worked tirelessly to convince all parties of the importance of this step. There has always been a state of confrontation between the government and the opposition. Today, we are reopening this issue, and it is our duty to engage in dialogue with all other Syrians—because they, too, are Syrians. That, above all, is what matters'.

She concluded: 'The very presence of Syrian delegates here in Sochi is, in itself, a positive initiative—and a step in the right direction'.
