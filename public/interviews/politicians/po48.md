<h4>A Strategic Shift in Syrian Conflict Resolution</h4>

<b>Summary:</b>

The Astana platform emerged at a critical juncture in the Syrian conflict, marking a decisive shift from stalled international negotiations to a more pragmatic, regionally anchored approach. Launched in 2017, the Astana talks were designed to address both the military and political dimensions of the war, forging ceasefire mechanisms while gradually opening space for direct Syrian-Syrian dialogue. Unlike the Geneva process—hampered by diplomatic stagnation and often perceived as detached from ground realities—Astana reflected the realpolitik of regional powers, most notably Russia, Iran, and Turkey.

Among the visionaries behind this initiative was Randa Kassis, one of the first figures to advocate for an alternative negotiation venue. In 2015, well before the platform formally took shape, she called upon then-President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan to host Syrian peace negotiations—a proposal that would later prove foundational. Kassis not only conceived of the Astana platform but also played an active role in its launch, participating in the inaugural military-focused meeting. During this pivotal moment, she held key discussions with Kazakh Foreign Minister Kairat Abdrakhmanov, as well as Russian officials Alexander Lavrentiev and Sergey Vershinin, helping to lay the diplomatic and logistical groundwork for what would become a central pillar of Syria’s reconciliation process.

Her early involvement was more than symbolic; it was strategic. By pushing for a space in which military representatives of both the Syrian regime and opposition could meet face-to-face, Kassis underscored the necessity of addressing military realities as a precondition for political progress. The Al Mayadeen TV report recognised her instrumental role, framing the Astana process not merely as a product of geopolitical necessity, but as the realisation of a diplomatic vision first articulated by Randa Kassis.
