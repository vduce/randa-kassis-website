**Interview with Randa Kassis** _France 3 –_ _Soir 3_ 15 March 2013

**Summary:**

Randa Kassis, Chair of the Movement for a Pluralist Society in Syria, firmly opposes the international push to arm Syrian rebel factions, particularly with surface-to-air missiles. While she acknowledges the devastating militarisation of the Syrian conflict over the past two years—marked by rising casualties and escalating brutality by the Assad regime, supported by Russia—she warns that further arming the opposition is both dangerous and misguided.

Kassis highlights the fragmented nature of the opposition, noting that many groups lack cohesion and are increasingly influenced or dominated by jihadist extremists who reject secular and pluralist values. The risk, she argues, lies not only in an escalation of violence but also in the empowerment of radical forces whose vision for Syria fundamentally contradicts democracy and coexistence.

Moreover, she criticises the current opposition coalition for its lack of inclusivity, noting its failure to represent the diverse ethnic and religious makeup of Syrian society—including minorities and numerous secular Sunni voices. This absence of broad representation, compounded by internal rivalries, undermines its political legitimacy and weakens its capacity to negotiate or govern effectively.

Kassis calls on the international community—particularly France—to reconsider policies that risk fuelling further chaos without a clear understanding of who is receiving the weapons. She urges a shift away from military solutions towards a genuine political process that includes all components of Syrian society. Only through inclusive dialogue, she insists, can Syria hope to find a path out of its devastating conflict.
