**Randa Kassis to Sada al-Sham: Russia Now More Capable Than Ever of Imposing a Political Solution** _Sada al-Sham_ 11 November 2015 By: Mustafa Mohammad

Randa Kassis, head of the Movement for a Pluralistic Society, believes that Russia remains fully capable of imposing a political solution. In an exclusive interview with Sada al-Sham, Kassis stated that the “Geneva” talks largely depend on the “Astana” initiative and described the ongoing consultations in Vienna as a “long-term process”. The full transcript of the extended interview follows.

**Where does Randa Kassis see herself—among the Syrian opposition, aligned with the regime, or on an alternative path?**

I don’t believe there is a third path. There is no doubt that I stand with the opposition. But the real question is: what opposition actually exists?

On the Syrian scene, there is an opposition that believes in a military solution—and I do not consider them political opponents. Political opposition implies employing political methods to achieve change. And what does that entail? It means recognising the reality on the ground in Syria. We must seek appropriate means to resolve the conflict and end the war. That must come first. Then, we must gradually work towards changing the Syrian regime, in accordance with that reality.

**Had the regime wanted a political solution, we wouldn’t be in this situation. Do you still believe it is serious about reaching one?**

After more than four years, can anyone still seriously believe in the success of a military solution—whether for the regime or for the armed groups? Ultimately, what do we want? As political opposition, we want change, like everyone else—but through political means, not militarisation and armed conflict.

**And where is the politics in the regime’s conduct? We won’t delve into the militarisation of the revolution—it is perhaps old news.**

Who said we were seeking change in partnership with the regime? Of course the regime does not want a political solution. It has no interest in change. Like others, it still clings to the belief that a military solution is possible. The real challenge lies in forging a political solution—and that solution will not emerge from the regime. It must come from external powers that support state institutions and seek to prevent their collapse.

We cannot simply demand that the regime step down—that is not a viable option. Therefore, at this stage, we must establish a power-sharing government with clearly defined responsibilities. Bashar al-Assad must transfer part of his powers to this government—and that is the proposal I am putting forward.

**This is precisely what the regime wants. But when you speak of “countries supporting institutions”, are you referring to Russia?**

Absolutely. I believe the solution lies with Russia.

**But doesn’t Russia’s direct military intervention make it unfit to act as a neutral party in any political solution?**

On the contrary—Russia is now more capable than ever of enforcing a political solution. Precisely because it has intervened militarily, it has the ability to pressure the regime and impose a settlement—contrary to what many assume.

I’m not saying we should sit idle, waiting for Russia or others to hand us a solution. We, as Syrians, must contribute and present our own vision. That is why, in Astana, we proposed a realistic, pragmatic initiative: the formation of a coalition government, parliamentary elections open to all, and constitutional reform. Such elections cannot be held under the current constitution.

Our first priority, therefore, is to change the constitution. Once this is done and Parliament is granted real powers, the political solution can begin.

**Has Russia’s military intervention changed your position towards it?**

Ultimately, I want a solution for Syria. And if we are genuinely seeking one, we must separate reason from emotion. Emotion will only drag us further into destruction. We need to think rationally, make use of the current circumstances, and act accordingly.

**But has your view of Russia shifted in light of its military action, especially considering your long-standing support for its role as mediator?**

This isn’t about my personal opinion.

**My question concerns your stance as head of the Movement for a Pluralistic Society.**

Our movement believes that Russia has the capacity to bring about change—unlike Turkey, the United States, Qatar, or France. Why? Because those countries have no real presence on the ground. Russia can effect change. The next challenge will be how to deal with Iran, which also has a military presence.

**If the solution lies in Moscow, how do you address the fact that Russian and Iranian forces killed 878 Syrians—including 86 children and 65 women—in just the first two weeks of Russia’s intervention?**

Killing innocent civilians is unacceptable—regardless of who commits the act. But unfortunately, we are in a state of war. If we fail to acknowledge that, we will never reach a solution. On the contrary, our movement seeks to end this bloodshed—particularly the killing of innocent civilians.

What is the purpose of condemnation? Any activist can denounce these actions—but such words achieve nothing. Our aim, as a political movement, is to bring about change and end this war. That’s why we do not engage in condemnation. We are engaged in political work, which differs fundamentally from activism. Activists condemn; politicians work to solve problems.

**But we are speaking of innocent Syrian lives lost at the hands of Russian warplanes. Is that not worthy of condemnation? And beyond that—you are still meeting with them.**

Let me turn the question around: what is the alternative?

If we refuse dialogue with the Russians and take a hostile stance, then what? We are not condoning the killing of civilians—on the contrary, we are seeking to stop it. But in order to do so, we must take a realistic approach. We must work with the Russians to find a way to end this war.

**What has been achieved so far through the “Astana” conferences?**

As I mentioned earlier, the conference produced a proposed initiative that has now become an international reference point. What is taking place in Vienna today is built upon the Astana proposal. Moreover, the Astana initiative remains the only realistic proposal advocating constitutional reform and a coalition government.

**The coalition government proposal originated from Russia. Many have criticised you and other Astana participants—such as Dr Mahmoud Hamza, former president of the National Council for the Damascus Declaration in exile. In one article, he grouped you with Qadri Jamil and Fateh Jamous, accusing you of being marginalised, discredited figures hand-picked by Moscow to polish the opposition’s image. How do you respond?**

I will not justify myself. I simply refuse to stoop to that level—regardless of who made the remark, whether a “thinker” or otherwise. We are working far more seriously than many others. And then someone comes along and says: “You were created by the regime!” That accusation discredits itself.

**This criticism is not limited to one person. Many accuse you of being regime-friendly opposition.**

To those people I say: “The regime hates us more than it hates you—because we are moderate and realistic. We are the ones who can actually effect change—not those who merely chant slogans.” I have no interest in responding to such nonsense.

**You often mention Syrian minorities. Do you have a problem with the Sunni majority in Syria?**

I have no issue whatsoever with the majority. I want to address the root cause. The reason the regime still holds on is that minorities fear the unknown. Let’s be honest—there are thousands of extremist Islamists who have killed Alawites and Christians. But I am not blaming Sunnis.

**Then who are you blaming?**

I’m not lumping all Sunnis into one category. There are secular Sunnis—some even atheists—who are minorities in their own right. There are moderate Sunnis and Sufis, also minorities in this sense. When I speak of minorities, I include all these groups. I am not referring to the Sunni community as a whole, because it is not a monolith. In fact, everyone in Syria is a minority.

The problem is that some try to present the Sunnis as a unified majority, with the rest being minorities. Secularism is the solution—it can create a common national identity for Syria.

**You supported the goals of the revolution, at least in its early stages—is that true?**

Of course. I was among the first to call for regime change.

**Did the revolution ever call for self-administration? As far as we know, it demanded a free, unified Syria. How do you now promote Kurdish self-administration?**

The revolution’s demand was freedom—and freedom cannot be conditional. One of its outcomes is self-administration. If we truly seek freedom, we must respect others’ choices.

I support Kurdish self-administration and the right to self-determination, but I also want to build a state with a unified identity.

**Yet many politicians view the Kurdish self-administration project as a step towards secession. How do you respond?**

Let us leave the issue of secession aside and speak instead of federalism. There is a significant difference between the two. The United States is a federal state—so is Switzerland.

We want a model of federalism suited to Syria—not a replica of the American system.

**What are your expectations for the upcoming Vienna meetings?**

This will be a lengthy process, and we must support it earnestly. If we truly want Assad to depart, then we must support this path. It is the starting point from which other future paths may unfold.
