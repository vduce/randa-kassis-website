**Randa Kassis: “No constructive dialogue can emerge from Geneva II.”** _Europe 1 – Europe Soir_ 22 January 2014 Guest: Randa Kassis

**Summary:**

Randa Kassis, founder of the Movement for a Pluralistic Society, offers a trenchant critique of the opening day of the Geneva II peace talks. She expresses profound scepticism regarding the prospects for meaningful political progress, characterising the exchanges as mired in mutual recriminations and entrenched positions, leaving scant space for genuine dialogue. While she concedes that limited humanitarian measures—such as the establishment of corridors and the exchange of prisoners—may be within reach, she questions the capacity of the opposition coalition to negotiate effectively on behalf of the Syrian people.

Kassis underscores the geopolitical impasse between Russia—which continues to support Assad while remaining open to alternatives—and the United States, which remains fixated on Assad’s removal. She points to the complex and multifaceted nature of Syria’s internal landscape, shaped by ethnic and religious diversity, including the Kurdish self-administration experiment and the expanding role of Islamist factions within the opposition—developments she views as deeply concerning.

Advocating for a decentralised political solution—possibly a federal model—Kassis calls for a structure that respects regional and cultural distinctions without precipitating full fragmentation. In her view, Assad’s departure can only be achieved through an internal compromise involving the Alawite community, whose priority is not Assad’s personal leadership but the community’s continued existence.

She also warns of the growing threat posed by foreign jihadists, particularly the radicalisation of young Europeans, including minors, who are lured and manipulated by extremist groups. Kassis calls for an internationally coordinated response to terrorism, arguing that both the Assad regime and jihadist extremism pose existential threats to Syria’s future.

She concludes by highlighting the scale of the humanitarian crisis—millions displaced, exiled, or living in extreme precarity—and criticises the opposition’s inability to act with the seriousness demanded by the situation. For Kassis, any political solution must begin with alleviating the immediate suffering of the Syrian people: humanitarian relief must be the priority.
