**Opinions on the Protests in Syria** _France 24_ 29 March 2011 Guests: Ammar al-Qurabi & Randa Kassis

**Summary:**

The discussion addresses the deepening political unrest in Syria, rooted in long-standing repression, unfulfilled promises of reform, and the absence of democratic legitimacy under Bashar al-Assad. While early demonstrations were driven by hopes for change—such as lifting the emergency law, releasing political prisoners, and securing basic freedoms—these aspirations quickly gave way to disillusionment as the regime responded with violence, denial, and superficial concessions.

Randa Kassis remains firmly sceptical that Assad—who inherited power rather than attaining it through democratic means—was ever willing or able to reform the state. His presidency, devoid of popular legitimacy, rests on entrenched authoritarian structures and a legacy of suppressing dissent. The regime’s continued enforcement of emergency law for nearly five decades—under the guise of preserving national security—has become a potent symbol of repression, employed to silence opposition and obstruct any path towards genuine political participation.

Kassis asserts that true political transformation in Syria will require more than cosmetic gestures: it demands the abolition of the emergency law, free and fair elections, political pluralism, and leadership that derives its legitimacy from the will of the people. In the face of an entrenched regime unwilling to yield, she argues that sustained public pressure and resistance are essential to effecting real change.

The regime’s narrative—which frames the protests as foreign-orchestrated sectarian plots—is widely regarded as an attempt to delegitimise popular demands and fracture public opinion. Government tactics—including military crackdowns, the deployment of snipers in cities such as Latakia, and the manipulation of sectarian fears—reflect a broader strategy to maintain power through control rather than consent.
