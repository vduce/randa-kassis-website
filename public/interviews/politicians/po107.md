**Syrian Researcher and Writer Randa Kassis to Al-Madina** _Al-Madina_ 20 May 2011

The Syrian regime is accustomed to treating its people with arrogance. I believe it will relinquish power only once it has exhausted all means of control and realises that the Syrian people are resolute in continuing their struggle to the very end.

For the second consecutive month, demonstrations and protests have continued across various parts of Syria. What began in the southern city of Daraa has since spread nationwide, amid ongoing atrocities and massacres perpetrated by President Bashar al-Assad’s regime against unarmed demonstrators calling for political and social reform.

Al-Madina spoke with Syrian writer and researcher Randa Kassis, residing in Paris, for the following interview on the situation unfolding in Syria.

**Syria is known for its religious and ethnic diversity. Are the protests concentrated primarily in Sunni areas, or have they also reached Alawite regions?**

There is no doubt that the majority of those protesting for change come from the Sunni community, largely due to their demographic dominance in Syrian society. However, this does not mean that other minorities are not involved. While some among them do support the movement, their smaller numbers mean they are less visible. Just as there are Sunnis who support the regime, there are certainly individuals from minority groups who do so as well.

There are prominent Alawite figures who have endured imprisonment, torture, and professional exclusion—such as Damascus University economics professor Aref Dalila and Nizar Nayouf, who spent years behind bars and was released in a severely disabled state due to torture. Syria does not consist of villages or towns inhabited exclusively by one sect; rather, there are areas where one group may be more prevalent.

**Do you believe the Syrian army will remain neutral, or could it eventually side with the people and force Assad to step down?**

We have witnessed the brutal suppression of protests by soldiers under the command of special units. We have also heard accounts of some soldiers refusing to carry out orders to fire on demonstrators. However, this does not indicate a genuine split within the army, whose structure is fundamentally different from that of the Tunisian or Egyptian military.

Following the Hama massacre, Hafez al-Assad restructured the Syrian army to ensure that key positions were not only held by members of the Alawite sect, but also by individuals personally loyal to the Assad family. These individuals were hand-picked based on their direct ties to the ruling elite. For this reason, it is extremely unlikely that the army would stage a coup, split, or even maintain strict neutrality.

**Were the recent clashes in the Golan Heights orchestrated by Assad, or were they spontaneous in commemoration of the Nakba?**

Many analysts believe the regime deliberately incited unrest in the Golan region to send a clear message to the international community: Israel will not enjoy stability if Western rhetoric becomes more critical of Syria. The regime did little to conceal this strategy, having sent Rami Makhlouf to voice its position in an interview with The New York Times.

We must remember that in Syria, no public statement can be made without prior approval from the top of the hierarchy. By provoking unrest in such a sensitive area, the regime sought to divert both international and Arab attention away from the domestic protest movement.

**What are the possible scenarios for the future of the Syrian regime?**

In my view, the regime has so far responded to protests through repression, in the belief that this will either silence the opposition or push the country towards a form of civil war, enabling it to reassert control and tighten its grip on society. I also believe the regime thinks superficial legal reforms are enough to be perceived as “reformist” by the international community.

The regime has long treated its people with arrogance and condescension. If one examines Bashar al-Assad’s speeches closely, they are steeped in contempt for the Syrian people in all their diversity. That is why I believe the regime—particularly the Assad family—will not step down easily. However, I do think it will eventually do so, once it has lost all remaining leverage and becomes convinced of the people’s unyielding determination to persist. At that point, it may agree to relinquish power, provided it receives international guarantees of immunity from prosecution and is permitted to retain its wealth.

**What are the chances of Western intervention in Syria, similar to what occurred in Libya?**

Western intervention in Syria is highly unlikely, for a number of reasons. First, the United States is in no position to undertake another military intervention, given its ongoing entanglement in three exhausting conflicts: Afghanistan, Iraq, and now Libya.

The intervention in Libya was largely driven by French President Sarkozy, who sought to redeem his negative stance on Egypt and Tunisia and to pre-empt any developments in Libya. In truth, the operation was more of a salvage effort for French foreign policy, enabling France to be the first to host and recognise the Libyan Transitional Council. This also served to secure France’s interests in the post-Gaddafi era.

The Syrian situation, however, is markedly different. The Middle East is a far more complex and volatile region, where numerous powerful political forces intersect. Any military action against Syria risks destabilising an already fragile regional balance.

**Who do you think will govern Syria in the future?**

It is still too early to answer that question with any certainty. Nevertheless, there are certainly many capable individuals who could form a national government. Syria’s future governance will not be based on a single person or family but will involve representatives from multiple political parties. I do not believe democracy will be achieved easily, but we are witnessing the early stages of a democratic project. Many Syrians believe in this vision and are working tirelessly to make it a reality.
