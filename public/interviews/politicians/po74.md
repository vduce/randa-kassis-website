<b>Randa Kassis, what prompted you to co-author this book on Syria and the Arab Spring with geopolitical analyst Alexandre del Valle?</b>

Over several months, I examined the various analyses circulating about the Syrian crisis and found that most were overly simplistic. I therefore resolved to offer a more balanced and less Manichaean interpretation of this complex reality—beginning with an in-depth look at Syrian society, both in its ancient roots and recent history, to better understand its heterogeneity.

As a Syrian, I was careful not to view this book solely through my own lens. That is precisely why I chose to co-author it with Alexandre del Valle, a friend and expert on radical Islamism, whose external perspective brings valuable analytical distance.

<b>Would it be fair to say that the book articulates the core ideas and proposals of your political movement, the Movement for a Pluralistic Society? Could it be considered a first “manifesto”?</b>

Absolutely. The founding principles of our movement are pluralism, secularism, and federalism for Syria. We believe that the only viable path to gradual transformation within a united Syria—one that enables coexistence among its diverse communities—is through step-by-step implementation of these principles.

We assert that only a pragmatic and geopolitically realistic approach—one that avoids prejudice, binary thinking, and exclusion—can help us, alongside all actors and stakeholders in the Syrian question, to find a sustainable way out of the crisis.

<b>Since the start of the conflict, you have been a member of the Syrian National Council, later founded your own movement, and have tirelessly travelled to present your ideas to global powers. Do you sense that Western chancelleries—and Moscow—are beginning to listen to you?</b>

I do indeed hold regular discussions with Russian diplomats and decision-makers. They are open to all proposals that might help revive the political process and gradually bring about peace in Syria. Regrettably, France has distanced itself from such efforts. From the outset, it rejected any pragmatic political path, offering its exclusive backing to the Syrian National Coalition (SNC), whose members are little more than proxies for the Gulf petro-monarchies and Turkey. The latter, incidentally, bears a measure of responsibility for the spread of Daesh.

<b>Recently, Russia proposed the creation of a ‘platform’ on Syria aimed at developing a roadmap to resolve the crisis through non-intervention and inter-Syrian dialogue. Yet this very idea of a “platform” appears in your book, well before it was taken up by Russian diplomacy. Were you the one who persuaded them to adopt this new course, distinct from the Geneva I and II frameworks you have strongly criticised?</b>

Since the failure of Geneva II, we have maintained regular exchanges in pursuit of a shared objective: peace in Syria. It was within this sustained dialogue that we put forward the idea of a “platform” and a new initiative based, as we explain in Le Chaos Syrien, on pragmatic inter-Syrian dialogue.

I am pleased that this proposal has been partially adopted by Russian diplomacy—and by others. But the most difficult work still lies ahead. A sustained and determined effort is required if the Moscow meetings are to yield tangible, constructive results.

<b>Do you believe that the upcoming meetings in Moscow, centred on this “Syrian platform”, could lead to a resolution of the crisis?</b>

I am convinced that any viable solution must include the regime’s allies, particularly Russia, whose position and influence are essential. Unlike many actors, Moscow has the capacity to exert genuine pressure on Bashar al-Assad’s regime. To dismiss Russian views simply because they are perceived as too sympathetic to the regime is both counterproductive and absurd—and has contributed to the diplomatic stalemate since 2012. This has been one of the gravest errors of Western diplomacy.

This “platform”, now known as the Moscow Forum, whose inaugural meeting is scheduled for 26 January 2015, represents, in my view, the first concrete step in the right direction towards resolving this tragic and protracted crisis.

<b>Do you remain optimistic about the future?</b>

Yes—because we are condemned to remain optimistic if we are to preserve even the faintest hope of peace, or at least de-escalation, in the near future. It is essential to believe in the possibility of peace and to explore every pathway that might reduce tensions and encourage inclusive, pragmatic, inter-Syrian dialogue.

<b>What are your thoughts on the recent and horrific events in Paris? Do you see them as connected to what you refer to in your book as the “Syrian chaos”?</b>

First and foremost, my thoughts are with the families of the victims. The barbaric jihadist terrorist attack on the Charlie Hebdo newsroom—and the police officers protecting it—was a direct assault on one of democracy’s core values: freedom of expression.

These Salafist Islamist terrorists may act independently, but they are part of wider radical networks, many of which are rooted in Iraq and Syria, where Daesh continues its operations. What I find most disturbing is the rise of “individual terrorism”—perpetrated by self-radicalised individuals with limited resources and no clear organisational command. Yet the religious extremism that fuels this is far from new. We must address the root causes of jihadism with clarity and without illusion. The poison of jihadism began seeping into the Arab world in the 1960s. This is too often forgotten in the West, but in Syria, we witnessed it firsthand with the emergence of armed Islamist groups in the 1960s and 70s. Since then, the virus has spread across the Arab-Muslim world and into Europe, especially from the 1980s onwards.

It was during the first Gulf War in the early 1990s that jihadist fighters who had waged war in Afghanistan against the Soviet Union began to return or relocate to Arab countries—particularly Egypt. The same pattern followed in Iraq from the late 1990s and intensified after the 2003 invasion, which followed years of embargo and the destruction of Saddam Hussein’s secular Ba’athist regime. Upon those ruins, the seeds of a global jihadist plague were sown—first embodied by Al-Qaeda in Mesopotamia, and later by Daesh.

Today, their strategy—what might be called jihadism 2.0—is to ignite a transnational, global jihad against so-called “apostates” and “infidels.” The threat is global, and our response must be equally global, robust, and proportional.

<b>In your view, what have been the West’s main mistakes since the Arab Spring?</b>

As we explain in the book, the West’s principal failing has been its lack of pragmatism—combined with ideological, Manichaean, and deeply unrealistic activism. Some political leaders reacted impulsively and emotionally to media narratives, behaving more like campaigners than responsible statesmen with a long-term vision.

They aligned themselves too readily with the Gulf petro-monarchies and Turkey, giving little thought to the geopolitical implications or long-term consequences. Worse still, they continue to pursue this misguided strategy, seemingly unable—or unwilling—to extract themselves from the trap they themselves helped set. I deeply regret and strongly denounce this ongoing error.
