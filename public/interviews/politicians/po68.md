France 5 – C dans l’air  
21 May 2015  
Presented by Yves Calvi  
Guests: François Heisbourg, Pierre Servent, Randa Kassis & Wassim Nasr.

<b>Summary:</b>

This episode of C dans l’air centres on the alarming advances of the so-called Islamic State (Daesh), with particular focus on their recent captures of Palmyra in Syria and Ramadi in Iraq. The discussion explores the military, political, and geopolitical dimensions of the conflict, presenting a range of perspectives from a panel of experts.

Randa Kassis, president of the Movement for a Pluralistic Society, delivers a trenchant critique of both the Assad regime and the fragmented opposition. She argues that the West’s refusal to engage pragmatically with the region’s complex realities has severely undermined any prospect of a coherent political resolution. In her view, the exclusion of key actors — including elements of the regime and Russia — has created a dangerous vacuum, readily exploited by extremist groups such as Daesh. Kassis emphasises that no durable peace can be achieved without the inclusion of all regional stakeholders — notably Iran and Russia — in the negotiation process. She further underscores the collapse of Syrian state institutions and the disintegration of society as critical enablers of Daesh’s territorial expansion.

While military analysts on the panel highlight Daesh’s tactical agility — its deployment of mobile units, suicide bombers, and asymmetric warfare — Kassis contends that no volume of airstrikes or military manoeuvres will suffice without a concerted effort to address the profound political and social fissures in both Syria and Iraq. She cautions that continued reliance on militias and non-state actors, in the absence of a legitimate central authority, only serves to deepen sectarian divisions.

The destruction of Palmyra, a UNESCO World Heritage site, becomes a poignant moment of cultural mourning during the episode. Kassis laments not merely the physical obliteration of Syrian heritage, but the symbolic erasure of a pluralistic identity — a legacy Daesh is intent on extinguishing. The conversation also addresses the human cost of the conflict, with cities such as Kobane suffering widespread devastation. Kassis characterises the humanitarian catastrophe as both a tragedy and a political failure — the result of international incoherence and moral inconsistency.

In conclusion, the programme leaves little doubt that defeating Daesh will require far more than military force. Randa Kassis insists on the imperative of a realistic and inclusive political process — one capable of restoring governance, re-establishing legitimacy, and ultimately eliminating the conditions that allow extremism to take root.
