**Geneva Talks a Futile Exercise, Calls for Serious Mediation** _Al Ghad TV_ 26 February 2017

**Summary:**

In a pointed critique delivered during an exclusive interview with Alghad TV on 26 February 2017, Randa Kassis, President of the Astana Platform for the Syrian opposition, dismissed the Geneva negotiations as futile and devoid of tangible outcomes. She condemned the process as a theatrical exercise lacking substance, asserting that it merely served to waste time rather than advance any meaningful progress towards a political settlement.

Kassis directed sharp criticism at the UN Special Envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, accusing him of lacking both a coherent strategy and a clear understanding of his role as mediator. Rather than narrowing the divide between opposing factions, she argued, de Mistura had failed to fulfil even the basic expectations of his mandate. In a particularly scathing remark, she described him as a “big clown”, suggesting he had become a symbol of the stagnation afflicting the peace process.

Expressing disillusionment with the current trajectory of the talks, Kassis called for de Mistura’s departure and the appointment of a more competent and professional figure capable of conducting serious, results-oriented negotiations. She affirmed her belief that only such a shift in leadership could bring Syria closer to a credible and lasting political resolution.
