<h4>How France Abandoned Its Humanitarian Approach in Syria by Stubbornly Supporting the Wrong Side</h4>

<b>As President of the Movement for a Pluralistic Society, what do you believe are the key ambiguities in France’s diplomatic stance on Syria since its recognition of the Syrian opposition coalition in October 2011?</b>

France has made several significant errors on this issue. First and foremost, it recognised a coalition that holds no real influence over the armed rebel groups on the ground and is largely manipulated by external powers, particularly the Gulf monarchies—Saudi Arabia and Qatar—both of which are hostile to any meaningful political resolution.

Moreover, France has failed to return to a pragmatic and realistic policy regarding the Syrian conflict. Another troubling element is its peculiar support for the ambitions of an increasingly authoritarian Turkey under Erdoğan, particularly by backing his project to establish a buffer zone dominated by this neo-Ottoman agenda. Such a stance severely undermines France’s credibility.

More recently, France attempted to sideline Staffan de Mistura’s ceasefire proposal for the Aleppo region by co-opting the initiative and repackaging it as a no-fly zone—an objective closely aligned with Turkish interests—while overlooking the urgent humanitarian need to relieve civilian suffering. France today suffers from a lack of diplomatic influence and struggles to articulate a coherent vision, particularly after years of miscalculations during which it acted more as an activist state than a strategic power, misreading the balance of forces on the ground.

<b>What does this behaviour reveal about France’s true regional intentions?</b>

France is not acting in accordance with its own national interests, but is instead guided by the political amateurism of certain politicians or diplomats. The consequences of such a policy may lead to serious internal security concerns within France and across Europe. For some political figures, the Syrian crisis appears to have become a matter of personal involvement, rather than of rational foreign policy.

<b>Were there ever viable alternatives to supporting so-called 'moderate' Islamist rebels?</b>

Experience shows us that military solutions do not resolve such crises; they merely worsen them. They bring only further destruction and death to Syria. The only viable path forward is a political one—one that includes both Russia and Iran. Only the Russians possess the necessary leverage to influence and pressure the Syrian regime.

We must clearly identify the countries that are obstructing a political settlement and exclude them from the process. These states must also be held accountable—including Turkey, which continues to play a duplicitous role by facilitating the movement of jihadists into Syria while claiming to oppose extremism.

<b>To what extent could a new Alawite-led government possess the legitimacy required to stabilise the situation?</b>

It would be entirely unrealistic to abruptly remove the Alawites from positions of sovereign authority—particularly in the military and security sectors—without risking a power vacuum that could allow radical forces to seize control in Damascus. That said, Alawite officials will have to come to terms with the need to share power in the future. A balanced and inclusive political structure is the only path to long-term stability.
