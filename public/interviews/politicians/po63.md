The second round of reconciliation talks involving representatives of the Syrian opposition is scheduled to take place later on Friday in Astana, according to the press service of the Kazakh Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

The Secretary of State of the Republic of Kazakhstan, Gulshara Abdykalikova, will deliver a welcome address at the outset of the negotiations.

Earlier this year, Randa Kassis, leader of the Movement for a Pluralistic Society, along with other Syrian opposition representatives, appealed to the Kazakh leadership to host the second round of discussions.

The first round was held in Astana in May, gathering around 30 members of the Syrian opposition. The two-day talks concluded with the signing of a document summarising the outcomes of the negotiations.

Syria has been in a state of civil war for the past four years, with government forces engaged in combat against various militias, including the Islamic State.

The countryâ€™s warring factions have previously convened twice at UN-sponsored conferences in Geneva and twice in Moscow under Russian auspices, but have thus far failed to reach a tangible resolution to the conflict, which has claimed more than 220,000 lives.
