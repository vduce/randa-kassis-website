<b>How would you assess the Syrian crisis, two years after its outbreak?</b>

Randa Kassis: Since the Rwandan genocide, the world has not witnessed a humanitarian catastrophe of such magnitude. The scale of displacement and the number of refugees is staggering. Syria today is engulfed in utter chaos.

<b>Could you describe the current actors involved in the conflict?</b>

The political opposition is deeply fragmented, marked by profound ideological divisions. Syria is now home to a multitude of armed groups, each pursuing divergent—and often contradictory—objectives. The Free Syrian Army itself is riddled with internal fractures, with various brigades acting according to their own agendas or under the influence of foreign backers such as Qatar and Saudi Arabia. This has entrenched a precarious balance of terror and significantly complicated the situation on the ground.

<b>The so-called “international community” claims that the Syrian regime used chemical weapons against its own population and seeks to “punish” it. Do you have any insight into what actually occurred in Al-Ghouta?</b>

It remains extremely difficult to determine with certainty what truly happened. This is precisely why it is essential that the international community await the conclusions of the United Nations investigation before taking any action. The experts must be allowed to complete their work before any definitive judgement is rendered.

<b>How can we be sure who deployed these weapons?</b>

It is entirely plausible that certain armed factions—particularly Islamist groups—have obtained small quantities of chemical weapons. The situation is chaotic and extremely grave. That is why we must accelerate serious political engagement as a matter of urgency.

<b>The mention of chemical weapons inevitably brings to mind the false claims used by Western powers to justify the invasion of Iraq in 2003. Is history repeating itself in Syria?</b>

That is precisely why we must approach this crisis with caution and composure, and avoid emotionally driven reactions. It is easy to declare war; it is far more difficult to secure peace. Achieving peace in Syria will require unwavering determination on the part of several states, who must push all sides towards meaningful negotiations and an eventual compromise. Only through such a process can we hope to rebuild a state based on the rule of law—one that respects the full spectrum of Syria’s religious and ethnic diversity.

<b>Why do representatives of the Syrian opposition in exile continue to reject a political solution?</b>

It is the Syrian National Coalition (SNC) that rejects any political settlement. The reason is simple: it lacks the autonomy to act independently. In reality, the SNC operates under the influence of Qatar and Saudi Arabia—two states that wield considerable power over its decisions. Its members function more as emissaries of these petro-monarchies than as representatives of democratic aspirations. I believe that speaks for itself.

<b>What do you believe is the way forward? Is dialogue still possible?</b>

Dialogue remains the only viable path to peace. It is through political negotiation that we can begin to construct a common framework for coexistence—one that recognises and respects our differences. A central role must once again be given to a figure of peace such as Lakhdar Brahimi, whose diplomatic skill and moral authority are essential to steering the process towards a lasting and inclusive solution.
