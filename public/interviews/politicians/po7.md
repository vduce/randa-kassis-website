**“Secular Federalism” Is the Key to Syria’s Stability** _Al Dostor_ 22 December 2024 By Samira Ibrahim

Following the fall of the Assad regime, Syria has experienced profound divisions within the opposition, with divergent visions emerging regarding the country’s future. The role of regional and international powers in supporting peace and reconstruction has come increasingly into focus.

In this context, Al-Dostor conducted an interview with Syrian author and politician Randa Kassis, addressing the key challenges facing the Syrian opposition, the means of achieving stability, and Egypt’s pivotal role in supporting political solutions.

Kassis articulated her view that the adoption of a secular federal system is essential to preserving Syria’s unity and tackling the country’s economic and political crises. She also discussed the role of international actors such as Russia and China in the reconstruction process, stressing the importance of involving all parties in shaping Syria’s future, rather than allowing any single faction or group to monopolise power.

Here is the full text of the interview:

**You called on opposition forces to convene a general meeting to formulate a unified vision for Syria’s future… What is this vision?**

To this day, the Syrian opposition has yet to reach agreement on a unified vision for the future shape of the Syrian state, with each faction maintaining its own perspective. Nevertheless, it remains imperative to work towards a set of common principles concerning the country’s structure and future constitution, as a basis for achieving broad political and societal consensus.

In this regard, the Astana political platform and the Movement of Pluralistic Society—both of which I chair—propose the adoption of a secular federal system as a solution that safeguards Syria’s unity and territorial integrity while addressing the country’s considerable internal diversity.

The federalism we advocate—referred to as decentralisation by some political actors—is not intended to fragment Syria, but rather to ensure a fair distribution of power between the central government and the provinces. Such an arrangement would strengthen local governance and prevent the resurgence of authoritarianism. Under this model, sovereign matters such as foreign policy, national defence, and the economy would remain under the remit of the central government, while provinces would be empowered to manage their internal affairs in accordance with their social, economic, and cultural specificities.

**And what of secularism?**

What we propose is the neutrality of the state in matters of religion and belief. This guarantees that all citizens and communities are treated equally before the law, free from religious or sectarian discrimination. It ensures freedom of religion and thought for all individuals and prevents the exploitation of religion for political purposes, thereby contributing to the development of a more just and stable society.

**What are the main challenges facing the new authorities? And is the transitional government capable of overcoming them?**

If you are referring to the government led by Ahmad al-Sharaa, the Commander-in-Chief of the Syrian administration, then the challenges it faces are far more daunting than those that would confront a broader, more inclusive government incorporating the full spectrum of existing political and military forces.

There are several reasons why such a government is unlikely to meet the expectations of the Syrian people:

1.  A government comprised of al-Sharaa, his affiliates, and the armed factions loyal to him cannot be considered a legitimate authority representative of Syria’s diverse social fabric. This lack of representativeness will only prolong its international isolation.
2.  As a consequence, the economic sanctions imposed on Syria are likely to remain in place, and reconstruction efforts will continue to be paralysed.
3.  In such conditions, an al-Sharaa-led government would suffer the same economic and social failures as the Assad regime, lacking both the international support and legitimacy required to lead a meaningful political transition or economic recovery.

Furthermore, although Qatar may be willing to fund this government temporarily, it cannot bear the cost of reconstruction alone. The rebuilding process demands vast financial resources that only a coalition of states and international organisations can provide. Without broad international recognition and legitimacy, attracting such funding becomes nearly impossible.

In short, this kind of government would not only fail to represent the Syrian people but would also face insurmountable financial and political challenges, rendering it incapable of fulfilling the people’s aspirations for stability and prosperity.

**How can a smooth transfer of power be achieved?**

Undoubtedly, several stages must precede this transition. The first, as I have already mentioned, involves a broad-based meeting of all political forces to agree on foundational principles for the transitional phase.

Subsequently, the outcome will depend on al-Sharaa’s intelligence, pragmatism, and patriotism—his ability to recognise that forming a government unilaterally or seeking to monopolise power will not lead to Syrian stability nor to the fulfilment of his own ambitions. The only viable path for Syria is one rooted in genuine power-sharing and inclusive governance, which is essential for a successful political transition.

If al-Joulani refuses to adopt this approach and insists on excluding others from the state-building process, it will signal a desire to prolong the conflict. Yet even then, the process will not end with al-Joulani; the will to restore Syria as a homeland for all its people will persist, regardless of the challenges.

**How should the new authority engage with the Alawite and Druze communities?**

Al-Joulani adheres to a rigid and radical religious ideology. His history as a former member of ISIS and later al-Qaeda does not suggest any genuine ideological evolution. This background renders it difficult to imagine him as a figure capable of leading a comprehensive national project that includes all components of Syrian society, or of embracing a pragmatic political vision that transcends the narrow ideological frameworks to which he has long been wedded.

Moreover, the problem lies not only with al-Joulani himself but also with his inner circle and the armed militants under his command—especially given the presence of non-Syrian jihadists within his ranks. This reality bodes ill not only for religious and ethnic minorities, but even for secular Sunnis—particularly women. We have already witnessed how women are treated in Idlib, where draconian restrictions have severely curtailed their freedoms under a repressive, quasi-police regime.

This approach fosters fear and mistrust among Syria’s various communities and underscores the fact that al-Joulani’s ideology and organisation are fundamentally incompatible with the principles of freedom and equality that are essential for the construction of a modern, stable Syrian state.

**How can the Syrian economy recover, and how long might it take?**

The answer to this question hinges on al-Sharaa’s comprehension of Syria’s complex reality, as well as the regional and international community’s understanding of the political landscape and the prospects for a lasting solution.

It is crucial to maintain steady pressure on al-Sharaa and his organisation, without being swayed by any promises they may offer. We have already witnessed how the Taliban, upon assuming power, issued numerous pledges only to renege on them shortly afterwards—leading to a tragic deterioration in the status of women and the imposition of severe restrictions across all aspects of life.

We must learn from such experiences and ensure that Syria does not follow a similar path, where empty promises exacerbate the suffering—particularly for vulnerable groups such as women, minorities, and secular voices within Syrian society.

**How should the Syrian leadership address the Israeli front?**

Regrettably, Syria’s military arsenal has been severely depleted by repeated Israeli strikes, with estimates suggesting that approximately 80% of its weaponry has been destroyed. This places Syria in a position of profound weakness, unable to mount any meaningful military response. At present, the only available recourse is diplomatic protest and appeals to the international community to pressure Israel into complying with international resolutions.

That said, to speak frankly, I do not currently see any effective means or realistic options capable of reversing the situation or restoring a balance of power on the ground.

**Egypt is a key state in the Middle East and a peace broker. What role is expected of it in achieving peace in Syria?**

There is no doubt that Egypt plays a critical role in supporting Syria’s stability—beginning with its backing of political movements and efforts to promote negotiated solutions, rather than leaving the arena to military factions which only deepen divisions and prolong the suffering of the Syrian people.

Looking ahead, Egypt holds a pivotal role in advancing peace throughout the broader Middle East. Thanks to its regional stature and diplomatic weight, Egypt is well-positioned to act as a robust and influential mediator—capable of fostering dialogue and understanding among the various parties, and thereby contributing to the emergence of a more stable and prosperous regional environment.

**Who will bear the cost of reconstruction?**

If we manage to form an inclusive political government that represents all segments of Syrian society, it would be possible to establish strong partnerships with Arab countries and certain Western states to support reconstruction and stabilisation efforts. Furthermore, China’s role must not be overlooked. It possesses vast financial resources and considerable capacity to contribute meaningfully to development and rebuilding initiatives.

A genuinely participatory government would enhance regional and international trust, paving the way for critical investments and vital aid aimed at rebuilding a new Syria grounded in the principles of shared governance and national reconciliation.

**In your view, is Syria at risk of partition, as some fear?**

As I stated earlier, this depends, first and foremost, on al-Sharaa’s willingness to engage in a comprehensive political process, and secondly on our collective ability—as political actors—to formulate a unified plan rooted in true partnership. This must safeguard Syria’s national interests while recognising its social and regional diversity.

This is not to suggest that a unified government would immediately resolve all the country’s problems. However, such a government could mark the beginning of a process aimed at laying firm foundations for a new Syria. Although this transformation may take many years, a carefully considered start based on national consensus is the only path to a better future.

**What, in your opinion, is the fate of the Russian military bases in Syria?**

At present, it is difficult to determine with certainty the fate of Russia’s military bases in Syria. What is clear, however, is that Russia appears to be reducing its presence compared to previous years. From what I understand, some naval and air assets have already been redeployed—reportedly to Tobruk in Libya.

That said, this does not imply a full withdrawal from Syria. Rather, it suggests that Russia is seeking to protect its military assets—including warships and fighter aircraft—especially in light of the uncertainty surrounding the future of al-Sharaa’s government. In my assessment, Russia is adopting a wait-and-see approach, closely monitoring Syria’s political and military developments before making any decisive moves regarding its continued presence.
