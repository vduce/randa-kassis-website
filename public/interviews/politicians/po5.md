**New Syrian Power: “Moderate Beheaders” or “Inclusive Islamists”?** _Atlantico_ 11 February 2025

Randa Kassis – anthropologist, Franco-Syrian politician and writer, and President of the Movement for a Pluralistic Society – is a well-known figure in the opposition to the former Baathist regime of Bashar al-Assad, which was overthrown by coalitions of Islamist and Sunni jihadist rebels backed by Qatar and, above all, Turkey. Since then, Western media and European capitals have tirelessly sought mitigating factors and signs of “moderation” to justify the gradual international recognition of HTS’s so-called “moderate beheaders” and their leader, Abu Mohammed al-Joulani – now rebranded as Ahmed al-Charaa – ever since donning a suit and tie in a bid to project a respectable image of himself and his new regime. His primary motivation, of course, is the lifting of international sanctions, particularly American ones (notably the “Caesar Act”), which obstruct the country’s reconstruction and hinder imports, exports, and international financial transactions.

Having just returned from Syria, where she met with Alawite, Druze and Christian minorities across the country before returning to the capital, Damascus, Randa Kassis shares her exclusive account and offers Atlantico her insights into the nature of the new power in Damascus. Standing in stark contrast to the clichés and widespread euphoria observed in the West regarding Joulani-Charaa, Kassis rejects the notion that the new – and in truth, fragile – master of Damascus and his former jihadist group have suddenly become “inclusive”, “tolerant” towards minorities and secularists, or are on the verge of becoming “democratic”.

Analysts not deceived by these likely displays of taqiya understand well that Joulani’s apparent gestures of moderation are, above all, driven by the objective of securing the lifting of sanctions against his country – a sentiment echoed by Emmanuel Macron during his phone conversation with Ahmed al-Charaa on 7 February, in which the Élysée extended an invitation for the Syrian president to visit Paris in the near future.

**You recently returned to Syria as President of the Movement for a Pluralistic Society, where you met with representatives of several communities, including Christians, Druze and Alawites. Do you still consider yourself an opponent of the new regime? What impression did this visit leave on you after years in exile? Are you optimistic about the new authorities in Damascus?**

I met, among others, Patriarch John X of the Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch and All the East, Sheikh Hikmat al-Hijri, the spiritual leader of the Unitarian Druze Community in Syria, as well as other religious, community and political figures. In truth, all of them appeared deeply concerned, and I can only remain opposed to this radical regime, which is far from democratic and refuses to share power with any other political forces. Damascus struck me as mournful, scarred by all it endured under Bashar al-Assad, and now more fearful than ever… People live in a climate of fear, and many of those I spoke to are terrified by the prospect of a new civil war.

There is nothing that inspires hope. Not to mention the countless Syrians from all communities who want neither a religious dictatorship nor the enforcement of Sharia law. The media often focus on ethnic and religious minorities, but forget the secular Sunnis, the Sufis, or simply those who reject the imposition of a religious regime. And yet, if we count all those who reject Sharia and aspire to a neutral constitution guaranteeing equality for all, we represent a majority, while those in favour are a minority. I also observe the hypocrisy of certain Syrians living in the West: they enjoy all the freedoms afforded by those countries, yet support Sharia law in Syria — either out of blind conformity or a spirit of revenge against minorities because of the former Alawite-Baathist regime. They go along with the tide without considering the consequences of what they advocate, even though they themselves would never accept living under such a regime.

**Has Al-Joulani (aka Al-Charaa) truly become more moderate or pragmatic? How do you explain the West’s leniency in so swiftly forgiving someone who once led a terrorist organisation and was considered public enemy number one?**

I believe there is a clear limit to Joulani’s pragmatism. He is not a politician, but a hardened jihadist who lived in caves in Iraq alongside Al-Qaeda. He was trained underground before being dispatched to Syria by Al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) to establish a local branch. Later, when Baghdadi announced the formation of ISIS in 2013, Joulani – who had originally been tasked with founding the Islamic State in Syria – refused to submit to Baghdadi’s authority, preferring to remain under Al-Qaeda’s umbrella. This split led to a bloody war between his group, Jabhat al-Nusra, and the so-called Islamic State.

But we mustn’t be fooled by this apparent rivalry. Joulani and his men remain criminals who have murdered Syrians of all faiths. When he formally broke with Al-Qaeda in 2016 and rebranded his group, it was not out of rejection of jihadist ideology, but pure opportunism – a calculated move to appear more palatable on the international stage. His objective has always remained the same: to retain power in his own hands. It is scandalous that certain states overlook his criminal past simply because he has managed to impose a degree of order. Such naïveté is unacceptable. If a drug cartel leader were to seize power, would we erase his crimes and legitimise him on the grounds that he brings a semblance of “stability”?

**Do you have evidence or testimonies from opponents or members of ethno-religious minorities who have been persecuted, harassed or massacred by groups affiliated with HTS or the SNA — the two coalitions that overthrew Bashar al-Assad?**

During my recent stay in Damascus, I witnessed radical preachers entering Christian neighbourhoods, calling residents infidels and urging them to convert to Islam. When young Christians tried to prevent them from posting leaflets dictating how women should dress, HTS members arrested them. We later learned this had been coordinated with the Ministry of Islamic Affairs. Similar incidents have occurred in various Christian districts across the country.

As for the Alawites, massacres have taken place in several villages in Homs, Hama, and other Alawite areas. Civilians were killed, including, most recently, a pregnant woman and her husband. Reports have also emerged of summary executions of former regime soldiers in HTS-controlled areas, with at least 35 people executed over just three days – mostly Alawites. Just

two days ago in Aleppo, armed men entered a flat and arrested transgender and homosexual individuals. They filmed themselves beating, humiliating and threatening to mutilate them. To this day, we still do not know their fate.

Moreover, I’ve received reports from contacts within Syria who were threatened to dissuade them from meeting with religious leaders of other communities. I myself experienced the pressure these groups exert. I was openly threatened during my visit. Only days ago, someone contacted my husband, Fabien Baussart, in an attempt to dissuade him from arranging meetings with religious and influential Syrian figures.

The interference didn’t stop there. A television channel had invited me for a live interview from Damascus. I later learned that members of HTS had demanded it be immediately cancelled. When the channel refused, they retaliated by threatening to expel the broadcaster’s provider. Following intense pressure, the channel’s management reached a compromise: the interview would not be rebroadcast or uploaded online. It took me two days to retrieve the censored recording. This experience perfectly illustrates the intimidation tactics and information control strategy employed by these groups, who seek to silence all independent or dissenting voices.

**Why don’t Western media or American and European leaders speak out about this?**

The Biden administration – which has been in dialogue with Joulani for at least two and a half years – has avoided severing ties. I doubt this administration intends to whitewash a terrorist as openly as some European leaders have done, whether out of fatigue or indulgence. Fearing a political vacuum in Syria, they now find themselves aligning with those they once deemed their worst enemies.

Tragically, these same leaders, unable to resolve their own internal crises and watching their global influence wane, cling to the illusion that they still possess leverage in the Middle East.

**What is the situation of the Alawites? Are they preparing, like the Kurds in the east or the Druze in the south, to resist? Do they still have weapons? Who will protect them – Russia, the United States, Iran?**

There are several currents within the Alawite community: some aspire to a federal state, as do other groups in Syria, while others prefer to remain silent, fearing reprisals. The core issue is the absence of a structured leadership capable of taking strategic decisions. Hafez and Bashar al-Assad systematically eliminated any figure who might have assumed independent political authority within their own community, leaving only coerced loyalty to the regime.

In terms of security, the Alawites have not entirely relinquished their arms. While some equipment has been returned, a portion remains hidden, kept in anticipation of a scenario in which their very survival may be threatened. But the main challenge is not simply possession of weapons – it lies in their capacity to organise a civil movement that is inclusive. An alliance with other communities along the coastal region could enable them to push for a neutral constitution, genuine power-sharing, and a decentralised Syria – demands already voiced in various parts of the country. It is along this path that a more stable and secure future might be forged.

**What about the Trump administration? What are the views of the new American president, Donald Trump, and his advisers on the new Syrian regime and the small US base of 900 troops supporting the Kurds in Syria?**

The Trump administration has repeatedly expressed its desire to withdraw US troops from Syria. However, the American military presence – now estimated at around 2,000 personnel (the official figure of 900 is outdated, as Biden increased it) – remains a strategic issue. While Trump maintains that he wants to repatriate these forces, some within his administration are acutely aware of the risks a hasty withdrawal would entail, particularly given the lingering presence of Islamic State sleeper cells. Such a withdrawal could allow the terrorist organisation to regroup and regain ground – especially as HTS fighters, disillusioned with Al-Charaa’s temporary policies of compromise, may defect and join ISIS ranks. So, although Trump intends to disengage the US from the Syrian conflict, a poorly managed pull-out could prove catastrophic – both for regional stability and for American counterterrorism interests.

**How will the Kurdish forces in the East manage to defend themselves against Turkey’s ambitions, the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA), and even HTS under Joulani, who seeks to subdue Rojava and thwart the federal solution you advocate?**

The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) – a Kurdish-Arab alliance controlling a quarter of Syria in the northeast, with the Kurdish YPG at its core and linked to the PKK in Turkey – have no choice but to fight for their survival. It is not a matter of strategy, but one of existential necessity. Such clashes could worsen the situation and ignite broader escalation, sparking multiple fronts across the country. Thus far, Joulani has avoided direct confrontation with the SDF – not out of any affinity, but out of caution. He knows that initiating a major battle would risk dismantling everything he has patiently built. At present, he lacks both the manpower and the military arsenal for a large-scale confrontation. His immediate goal is to secure recognition from certain Western states in order to consolidate his authority.

**And the Islamic Republic of Iran? Is it preparing a return to Syria via the Alawite coastal region, or through the eastern Kurdish-held areas?**

Iran has certainly not spoken its last word. I do not believe for a moment that it will relinquish its influence in the region. For now, its priority appears to be consolidating power in Iraq, particularly by ensuring the appointment of a Prime Minister favourable to its interests.

There is a real risk that Iran could back – or even create – new militias capable of supporting brigades opposed to the current regime. Should the Americans withdraw, the Kurds would be forced to seek alternative security arrangements – which could reshape alliances and further inflame tensions across the region.

**Do you believe the new Syrian leadership is fragile? Do you think it will manage to assert itself and suppress its internal rivals and enemies, without being eliminated by those who see Joulani as either too moderate or too extreme?**

I do not for one moment believe Joulani will be able to consolidate power or impose his ideology in the long term. If he were truly as clever as some claim, he would never have declared himself Syria’s president. Instead, he would have sought to manoeuvre diplomatically, working alongside other opposition groups supported by Qatar and Turkey to give the illusion of political plurality. Moreover, he does not have full control over his own men – particularly the most fanatical elements and foreign fighters. This was evident when he promoted a Uyghur jihadist within his ranks, without anticipating China’s reaction. These foreign Uyghur fighters, who arrived in Syria through international jihadist networks, have already expressed a desire to return to China and wage their own war against Beijing. This episode highlights Joulani’s political inexperience and his limited grasp of international dynamics.

He is now surrounded by enemies – both domestic and regional. His future appears uncertain: he could well be eliminated by his own inner circle or by rival factions that detest him.

**What about the forces of Ahmad al-Awdeh, leader of the Southern Brigades or “Southern Operations Room”, who arrived in Damascus eleven hours before HTS at the beginning of December 2024 to overthrow Bashar al-Assad? Could his force of nearly 8,000 men eventually clash with Joulani’s troops, or even ally with other southern forces like the Druze?**

So far, Ahmad al-Awdeh’s Southern Brigades have not entered into negotiations with Joulani. Dara’a province remains under the control of local clans, who are still armed and largely autonomous. This poses a significant challenge for Joulani, as neither HTS nor his influence extends to southern Syria, the Druze area of Sweida, or the Kurdish-held northeast. A military front along the western coast cannot be ruled out either.

It is also worth noting that Joulani does not truly control the entirety of northern Syria. Parts of the region, including Aleppo, remain under the influence or control of Turkish-backed Arab and Turkmen Islamist rebels of the Syrian National Army (SNA), formerly the Free Syrian Army. Their sole aim is to eliminate the Kurds in the east and establish a pro-Turkish buffer zone along the entire northern border. As for a possible confrontation between Ahmad al-Awdeh’s Southern Operations Room and HTS, it remains a possibility – particularly if local dynamics evolve in favour of alliances among southern forces, including the Druze, to resist Joulani’s expansion.

**What should we make of Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov’s recent visit to Syria? Is it true that the Russians have not yet definitively lost their bases in Syria – or at least still believe they can maintain or renegotiate them?**

To my knowledge, the Russians are actively negotiating to retain their two military bases in Syria. However, Al-Charaa/Joulani’s demands for compensation are not entirely acceptable to them. The main issue with Al-Charaa lies in his lack of understanding of international political dynamics. Despite backing from two or three countries, he lacks the experience and support necessary to navigate such a complex landscape. His administration has already committed several strategic errors. He is discovering a new world order without fully grasping its intricacies. As for Russia, it has not yet taken a definitive stance regarding him. For now, it seems content to manoeuvre cautiously – what might be called a diplomatic dance.

**Final question – beyond Syria: What is your view of the so-called “Kellogg Plan” for Ukraine, which Donald Trump’s special envoy is expected to present soon at the Munich Security Conference?**

As I understand it, the plan aims to freeze the conflict by leaving the occupied territories under Russian control while guaranteeing Ukraine’s non-accession to NATO. In return, security would be assured for the remainder of Ukraine. This would be acceptable to Russia, as its red line has always been preventing Ukraine from joining NATO.

It remains to be seen whether other components of the plan are negotiable, but it is unlikely that Russia would agree to return all the territories it has seized.

**And what of the ongoing negotiations between the Islamic Republic of Iran and the United States, and, in parallel, Donald Trump’s extraordinary proposal to seize the Gaza Strip and transform it into a prosperous “riviera” after forcibly relocating its population to Egypt and Jordan? Beyond the theatrics typical of Trump’s “deals”, what is your assessment of these negotiations on Gaza and Iran from a geopolitical standpoint?**

As for Trump’s “Gaza stunt”, it is patently absurd. Such a proposal would only worsen tensions with neighbouring countries – particularly Egypt and Jordan – who are being dragged into this fantastical idea of forced population transfer. But we know Trump is capable of changing his mind twice in a single day.

Regarding the first part of your question, Trump is currently negotiating with Iran on the nuclear issue – ironically, given that he himself scrapped the original agreement during his first term. Now, he seeks a new compromise, aware that Iran could, according to some estimates, develop four to five nuclear warheads within weeks. Such a prospect would render any pre-emptive strike ineffective. In this context, it is not inconceivable that Trump might abandon his Gaza proposal if he manages to strike a deal with Iran over its nuclear programme.
