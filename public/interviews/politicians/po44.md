**De Mistura Reaffirms the Need to Address All Agenda Items at Geneva V** _Al Ghad TV_ 25 March 2017

**Summary:**

In this interview with Al-Ghad TV during the Geneva V peace talks in March 2017, Randa Kassis, head of the Astana Political Platform, delivers a scathing critique of the UN-led negotiation process under Staffan de Mistura. She describes the Geneva talks as a “failed exercise” that merely squanders time and advances de Mistura’s personal ambition to extend his mandate, rather than achieving any meaningful progress towards resolving the Syrian conflict.

Kassis contends that the UN envoy harbours no genuine hope in the process and is simply gathering positions to present at the forthcoming Arab League Summit in Amman. She argues that the fragmented nature of the Syrian opposition—divided into delegations from Riyadh, Moscow, and Cairo—renders it ineffective against the more unified and diplomatically seasoned government delegation led by Bashar al-Jaafari.

Rejecting the Geneva framework altogether, Kassis underscores that the Astana Platform is pursuing a different, more pragmatic course, centred on drafting a Syrian constitution with the assistance of respected Syrian legal experts. She stresses that this initiative is not designed to impose a solution upon the Syrian people, but rather to lay the groundwork for a serious draft to be considered in future national dialogue. According to her, the constitutional process better reflects the actual priorities of the major international actors involved in Syria and offers a more constructive alternative to the stalled and theatrically managed Geneva negotiations.
