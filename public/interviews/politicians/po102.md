**Syria: In Silence, They Kill** _RTS (Radio Télévision Suisse), Infrarouge_ 28 February 2012 Guests: Anne Nivat, Fabrice Balanche, Jean-Souhel Gowrié, Manon Schick, Marie Seurat & Randa Kassis

**Summary:**

The figure is staggering: an estimated 7,600 people have been killed in Syria since the uprising began a year ago, with no sign that the violence is abating. Foreign intervention appears to be off the table, and Bashar al-Assad’s regime remains firmly in place. But how long can the world remain silent as civilians are slaughtered?

The Infrarouge programme offers a powerful and sobering exploration of Syria’s descent into tragedy, marked by impunity and a mounting human toll—nearly 8,000 deaths in a single year, most of them civilians. Through in-depth dialogue with Syrian expatriates, journalists, human rights advocates, and researchers, the broadcast delves into the regime’s brutal repression, the transformation of protest into armed conflict, and the sectarian and political fractures deepened by war.

The Assad regime’s actions are widely denounced as crimes against humanity, with some describing them as genocidal. Yet the international community remains paralysed, in part due to Russia’s military and diplomatic backing of Damascus. Independent verification is hampered by censorship, media restrictions, and the dangers facing humanitarian organisations. The question of foreign intervention remains divisive—some fear it would further inflame the conflict, while others see it as the only way to halt mass atrocities.

While many Syrians still dream of a secular, democratic future, the rise of Islamist extremism and the persistence of violence have cast doubt on such hopes. The programme concludes by reflecting on the suffering and resilience of the Syrian people, the courage of journalists risking their lives to bear witness, and the haunting silence of a world that continues to look away.
