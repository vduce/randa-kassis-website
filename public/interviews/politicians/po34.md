<h4>France cannot make itself heard as long as the Quai d’Orsay remains in the hands of neoconservative circles</h4>

Russia does not support Bashar al-Assad as an individual, but rather the existence of a functioning state in Syria.

Randa Kassis is a secular opponent of Bashar al-Assad whose analyses diverge from the usual Manichaean narrative and conventional portrayals. In early March, she will publish an essay titled Syria and the Return of Russia with Éditions des Syrtes, aiming to provide a “panorama of the geopolitical situation” in the Middle East. It was on this occasion that we met with her.

<b>You chair the Astana platform. What are your proposals for reaching a political solution to the conflict?</b>

I devoted the year 2017 to drafting a constitutional project, because I believe that a new Constitution, based on compromise, is a necessary precondition for the formation of a new government.

In contrast, the High Negotiations Committee \[backed by Saudi Arabia – Ed.\] insists on the establishment of a transitional government and the departure of Bashar as a prerequisite.

The failures in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Libya have demonstrated that all-or-nothing politics inevitably end in failure, as they involve excluding part of the population from the political solution.

<b>Has Bashar al-Assad won the war</b>

It is materially impossible for Bashar to reconquer the entirety of Syrian territory. This is fortunate, because if he could, no political solution would be viable. Moreover, Russia does not support Bashar al-Assad as an individual, but rather the existence of a form of statehood in Syria.

The FSA (Free Syrian Army), once central to America’s “regime change” policy in Syria, appears to have disintegrated. What is the current state of the “democratic” forces on the ground

<b>The FSA is a nebulous entity. Who is its leader?</b>

It has all the hallmarks of a phantom army, with its brigades forming alliances or defecting according to the flow of funding from regional powers. While ideology may be fluid, the funding is very real.

On the American side, the arrival of Trump has not altered the situation on the ground, as his administration remains at odds with his foreign policy. Moreover—and this is another source of deadlock—the Pentagon’s objective is not even to replace Bashar, but to prolong the crisis as part of a Cold War logic directed against Russia. In the end, the United States appears weak because it is internally divided.

<b>Can France still play a role in the peace process? Does its voice still carry weight?</b>

France has yet to renew its diplomatic personnel and cannot be heard as long as the Quai d’Orsay remains in the grip of neoconservative circles. It should prioritise dialogue with Russia (rather than the United States, which remains fixated on a Cold War mentality), while distancing itself from regional powers that manipulate jihadist brigades.

<b>Does the Russian-Turkish-Iranian troika hold the key to a political solution?</b>

The partnership between Russia and Turkey aligns with Syrian interests and must be preserved. Unfortunately, it has pushed the PYD \[Democratic Union Party – Syrian Kurdish political party – Ed.\] into the arms of the Americans; however, ties with the Russians have not been entirely severed. It is worth noting that the Kurds oscillate between the opposition—whom they sometimes coordinate with—and the Bashar regime, which they call upon for support against the Turks.

The three countries with whom Western powers refuse to engage—Russia, Turkey, and Iran—are the only possible guarantors of the Astana military process. The hostility of European nations is criminal, as it leads to deadlock.
