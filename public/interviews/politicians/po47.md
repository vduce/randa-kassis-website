<h4>Interview with Randa Kassis, Head of the Astana Platform of the Syrian Opposition</h4>

RT Arabic  
15 February 2017  

<b>Summary:</b>

The Astana talks commenced this morning in the Kazakh capital, with bilateral meetings between the guarantor states, Jordan, and the Syrian government delegation. These discussions are examining proposals related to the Syrian ceasefire agreement. Should current differences be resolved, the agreement may be formalised into a document tomorrow.

Some representatives of the armed opposition factions have already arrived in Astana, with the full delegation expected shortly. A broader meeting is scheduled for tomorrow at noon local time to address the main points of consensus.

RT then hosted Randa Kassis, head of the Astana platform of the Syrian opposition. When asked whether her presence in the same hotel as the talks was coincidental, she explained that the venue holds symbolic significance, having hosted Syrian opposition meetings in May and October 2015.

Kassis confirmed that she had met with the Kazakh Foreign Minister and described their conversation as highly positive. She expressed her belief that Kazakhstan could play a constructive role in the near future but advised patience until developments in Geneva unfold.

She criticised UN envoy Staffan de Mistura for what she described as a lack of neutrality, claiming that he leans towards the Riyadh platform to the detriment of others. Kassis stressed that the UN’s role must remain impartial—an attribute she believes de Mistura currently lacks.

Regarding the potential impact of the Astana talks on the Geneva process, Kassis drew a distinction between the military and political tracks, noting that while they run in parallel, they must remain separate. She opposes the inclusion of both military and political figures within a single delegation, arguing that each should remain focused on its respective sphere. Whereas the military controls the situation on the ground, political negotiations require a different set of competencies.

On the composition of the opposition delegation for Geneva, Kassis confirmed that the Riyadh platform had attempted to include certain individuals from other platforms while excluding others—most notably the Astana platform. She rejected the notion that the Riyadh group should lead the delegation, citing fundamental incompatibilities in political vision—particularly between the Riyadh platform’s Islamist orientation and the secular stance of platforms such as Astana and Cairo. She concluded that such ideological divergence renders the formation of a unified delegation under one leadership untenable.

Randa Kassis reaffirmed the exclusion of her platform from the delegation and questioned the legitimacy of any process that fails to reflect the full plurality of the Syrian opposition.
