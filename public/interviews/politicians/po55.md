<h4>Talks of the Second Round in Geneva</h4>

Al Mayadeen – Al Masaiya (Evening Bulletin)  
13 March 2016  
Guests: Hisham Marwa & Randa Kassis

<b>Summary:</b>

The episode opened with coverage of the second round of the Geneva III peace talks, as UN Special Envoy Staffan de Mistura announced that his meeting with the Riyadh delegation marked the formal commencement of negotiations. However, he was due to meet the Syrian government delegation the following day. The Riyadh delegation’s spokesperson expressed a guarded willingness to engage in the political process, coinciding with reports of a potential US initiative to bring Riyadh opposition figures together with Russian officials.

Joining live from Geneva, Randa Kassis—President of the Movement for a Pluralistic Society and Head of the Astana Initiative Committee—challenged the claim that the talks had truly begun, noting that no delegation had yet entered the UN building. She emphasised the importance of inclusivity and demanded the official recognition of the Secular Democratic Delegation, which she represents. Citing Resolution 2254, Kassis underscored the obligation to include all opposition factions, including those from Moscow, Cairo, and other independent initiatives.

Kassis further highlighted the essential participation of the Kurdish Democratic Union Party (PYD) in her delegation, particularly in discussions surrounding a ceasefire and the implementation of Resolution 2254. Without inclusive representation, she warned, the process risked replicating the failures of Geneva II.

She also criticised both the Riyadh and government delegations as ideologically rigid and unrepresentative. She accused the Riyadh group of espousing a Wahhabi identity that excludes Syria’s secular and pluralistic components, and questioned the legitimacy of any faction claiming to represent the Syrian people in the absence of democratic elections.

In response, Dr Hisham Marwah, Deputy Head of the Syrian National Coalition, speaking from Ottawa, defended the Riyadh delegation as the outcome of the most comprehensive opposition consensus to date. He advocated for neutral terminology in media discourse and stressed the primacy of humanitarian concerns—ceasefires, prisoner releases, and access to besieged areas. Regarding the controversial inclusion of groups such as Jaysh al-Islam, Marwah maintained that engaging with armed actors on the ground was necessary to secure the implementation of political agreements.

Kassis countered with sharp criticism, branding Jaysh al-Islam leaders Zahran and Mohammed Alloush as war criminals who had committed atrocities, including using civilians as human shields. While she acknowledged the unavoidable need to engage with power holders on the ground, she insisted that the international community must first clearly define who constitutes a legitimate party in the political process.

The episode concluded by highlighting shifting global alignments. While the Gulf states, Turkey, and Syrian opposition factions continue to prioritise President Assad’s removal, the United States and Russia appear increasingly aligned in their efforts to combat ISIS. This emerging focus may sideline other actors. Nonetheless, opposition delegations travelled to Geneva, even if some did so with merely a symbolic presence in order to avoid political irrelevance.
