<h4>From the Days of Geneva: Syria Between the Beauty and the Terrorist</h4>

<b>Summary:</b>

It is said that camera lenses are naturally drawn to what is different and unusual. Here, on the shores of Lake Geneva—where the spirit of the Syrian negotiations lingered amid a silence verging on tedium—the grand Swiss hotels buzzed with delegations from both the Syrian opposition and the regime. UN envoy Staffan de Mistura shuttled between the parties, hoping to reach a breakthrough. He did not succeed and ultimately turned to those who truly held the levers of influence.

On the regime’s side, Bashar al-Jaafari stood out as the uncontested media figure. Some even likened him to a peacock, strutting confidently and commanding attention.

On the opposing side, the picture was far more fragmented. The Riyadh-based opposition and the secular democratic opposition appeared to stand on opposing banks—divided in both form and substance.

Mohammad Alloush, representing Jaysh al-Islam, arrived amidst a wave of controversy surrounding his inclusion—largely due to Russia’s designation of his group as a terrorist organisation. He checked into the Neva Hotel under the protection of Swiss security forces and seemed rather accustomed to such treatment. Only one detail reportedly unsettled him: the nudity of some of the hotel’s statues.

Journalists hurried to interview the political head of Jaysh al-Islam, eager to understand how this so-called “terrorist” had suddenly appeared in their midst—not merely speaking, but leading negotiations. He declined to comment on the notorious incidents in which civilians were placed in cages and used as human shields. Such matters, he suggested, were secondary. The primary goal was clear:

“Toppling the Assad regime. Russia’s legal argument rests on Bashar al-Assad. But Assad has lost all legitimacy. Any president who murders his own people forfeits his legitimacy. Legally speaking, Assad’s mandate has expired. There is now a constitutional vacuum. The mock elections he held were recognised only by Iran and Russia.”

In the corridors of the United Nations and on television screens, however, another figure was drawing attention—a striking woman whose fierce arguments and presence turned heads: Randa Kassis.

Randa Kassis is a Syrian politician, writer, and human rights advocate, and president of the Movement for a Pluralistic Society. A prominent secular voice within the Syrian opposition, she has consistently called for a political solution that avoids both tyranny and religious fundamentalism. She believes secularism is the key to addressing Syria’s complex social fabric and building a stable future for all its communities.

On air and off, Kassis defended her group’s participation in the negotiations as a genuine opposition force, pushing back against claims from the Riyadh opposition that her faction was too close to the regime. She rejected the suggestion that de Mistura had invited them merely as “advisers”:

“We don’t see ourselves as being closer to the regime. It is they who represent Wahhabism and defend it. There’s no need to start trading accusations. Is this how the opposition expects to confront the regime—by tearing each other apart?

You call them Wahhabis—yes, certainly. So they should stop accusing others and accept the idea of two delegations. Why not? One could represent a specific vision—perhaps that of the Gulf, or more precisely, Saudi Arabia—and the other would uphold a secular identity.

It is our responsibility to carry the secular vision forward. We will ultimately be the ones to build a secular Syria.”

Randa Kassis champions secular democracy as a necessary foundation for peace and reconstruction. In contrast, Mohammad Alloush promotes the implementation of Islamic Sharia, which he studied in Damascus, Beirut, and Medina. Alongside his comrades in Jaysh al-Islam, he began applying Sharia law in Eastern Ghouta.

So, to which vision will Syria ultimately incline? Secularism—or political Islam, in its many forms?
