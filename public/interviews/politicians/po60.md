<b>Amid the ongoing debates among the parties involved in the Syrian crisis, as well as the states invested in its outcome, is there a comprehensive project proposed by any opposition group that you consider a lifeline for the Syrian people in this ordeal?</b>

<b>Is there a political vacuum within the existing proposals for a solution, and how might it be filled? Has the downing of the Russian jet altered the balance of power in the Syrian equation?</b>

<b>We put these questions to Syrian politician and writer Randa Kassis, President of the Movement for a Pluralistic Society, who began by stating:</b>

'It is hardly surprising that a political vacuum exists after decades of repression under a totalitarian regime in Syria. What is surprising, however, is that there remain Syrian figures who aspire to play a political role in the Syria of tomorrow, yet remain incapable of grasping reality after more than four years of conflict. This is precisely why I believe the stance of our movement, along with that of our pragmatic political allies, is essential: to formulate a realistic, gradual, and implementable solution to emerge from this crisis. Our dialogue with the Russian state is a pragmatic one, aimed at reconciling perspectives in order to preserve the Syrian state and prepare for a transitional political alternative capable of initiating a gradual process of change'.

<b>On the matter of the Russian jet shot down by the Turkish government, Kassis added:</b>

'Turkey made a grave error in downing the Russian jet and in the subsequent killing of one of the pilots by its Turkmen fighters on the ground. However, I do not believe this took place without the knowledge of the United States. Undoubtedly, this blunder will carry serious consequences and is unlikely to yield the intended results for either the Turkish or American sides; on the contrary, it is likely to backfire'.

<b>Regarding Kassis’s views on the role of Syrian women throughout the revolution—particularly their military engagement in Rojava, as well as their presence and influence within the Syrian opposition and at peace conferences—she stated:</b>

'Despite the scale of death, destruction, and displacement, there remains a positive and promising aspect in the Kurdish experience—especially with regard to women’s participation across all sectors. This experience could serve as a catalyst for change and the abolition of discriminatory laws against women in other regions.

Women now have a historic opportunity to enter political and other spheres as genuine partners in decision-making—not merely as ornamental figures, which, regrettably, remains the case in both the opposition and the regime. Both continue to reflect a culture of discrimination against women'.

<b>As for her assessment of recent conferences on the Syrian issue, including the Vienna talks, and her evaluation of the proposed solutions, she said:</b>

'We met in Astana twice, and the second meeting produced a pragmatic initiative that could serve as a foundation for resolving the Syrian crisis. As we have seen, the plan put forward in Vienna coincides with our initiative on several key points'.

<b>Kassis concluded with a remark on the upcoming meeting scheduled to take place in Saudi Arabia:</b>

'Regrettably, certain countries—chief among them the United States—have played, and continue to play, a negative role in undermining the Vienna plan by pushing Saudi Arabia to organise a meeting for Syrian opposition figures in Riyadh.

This move is rejected by a rational segment of the opposition. Asking Saudi Arabia to host such a meeting is akin to asking Al Capone to organise a summit against organised crime—or having Al-Baghdadi convene one, given that Daesh’s ideology stems directly from the heart of Wahhabism—that is, from Saudi Arabia itself'.
