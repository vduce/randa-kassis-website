**Justice for the Kurds: A Prerequisite for a Modern and Humane Syria** _Gulan Media_ 10 January 2012

Randa Kassis, member of the Syrian National Council, told Koulân: “A modern, humane and civilised state cannot emerge in Syria without addressing the rights of the Kurdish people and working towards justice, including the restoration of all their usurped rights.”

Kassis is a visual artist and writer specialising in anthropological-psychological research. She is one of the founding members of the Arab Association for the Defence of Freedom of Expression, based in Paris. Currently, she serves as President of the General Assembly of the Secular Democratic Syrian Coalition and is a member of the Syrian National Council, working in its Foreign Relations Office in Paris. In this exclusive interview with Kulan, she shares her views on the situation in Syria and the rights of the Kurdish people.

**The situation in Syria has reached a bloody turning point. Most observers and political analysts now predict the outbreak of civil war between the Syrian people and regime loyalists. How do you assess this critical phase, and what is the way out?**

There is no doubt that several scenarios are possible for Syria, but none can be separated from the country’s geopolitical depth. It is clear that the Syrian regime is attempting to use sectarianism as a tool for its own survival. With limited international influence at present, its battle has become one of sheer survival. Yet I still lean towards the possibility that the regime might seek a safe exit once it fully realises there is no chance of staying in power.

In this regard, I believe that intensifying our discourse and internationalising the Syrian issue are essential steps to prompt decisive action against a regime that continues to rely on the weakness of international will. We must work to steer events towards the least costly scenario for the Syrian people—one in which the solution arises from within the regime itself through internal fracture. This, in my view, requires a clear vision from the opposition and a firm call to refer the Syrian case to the UN Security Council.

**The Assad regime has arguably reached the “point of no return”, meaning that talk of reform or survival is no longer viable. The only solution now is Assad’s departure, which requires international, Arab and regional support to assist the Syrian people in toppling the regime. However, external support remains insufficient. What are your expectations in light of this pessimistic outlook?**

I believe the Syrian street will accept nothing short of Assad’s trial or departure, especially after the enormous number of deaths and injuries, not to mention the countless detainees languishing in the regime’s dark prisons. That is why the opposition must close ranks and unite around this fundamental demand of the people.

It is true that, to this day, we have not achieved enough to push the Security Council to take a firm stance on Syria. Yet I believe human relationships are generally based on cooperation to achieve shared strategic interests. Therefore, we must work to create incentives and motivations that will encourage the international community to support the process of change in Syria.

**The Syrian opposition abroad has had very limited influence over the internal situation and in organising the Syrian people. To date, it has failed to unite the various factions. The Kurds, a key component of Syrian society, remain outside the opposition framework. In your view, can the opposition in its current state play any effective role in toppling the Assad regime?**

Undeniably, we are still burdened with a cultural legacy that excludes anyone who differs from the dominant majority. And it is equally clear that we need all segments of Syrian society to bring about change—both in the short term, aimed at toppling the Assad regime, and in the long term, aimed at establishing a state of equal citizenship regardless of ethnicity, religion, or gender.

This cannot be achieved without fully recognising the rights of the Kurdish people, as well as all other ethnic groups. Belonging to the nation is something individuals feel when they experience recognition and see their rights upheld. This sense of inclusion enables the individual ego to integrate into the collective without erasing its uniqueness. We must move away from the pursuit of a singular identity for all groups and individuals.

**Some observers and political analysts say the Arab Spring is turning into a winter of political Islam. As for Syria, many predict that the alternative to Assad will be the Muslim Brotherhood or other Islamist movements. Would Syria become a democratic state under absolute Islamist rule—or merely undergo a change of faces?**

Ethnic and religious minorities in Syria make up around 35 to 40% of the population, and these communities tend to favour secularism because it offers them security and equality. In addition, secular Sunnis represent around 10 to 15% of the population. So I do not foresee an absolute Islamist rule or the rise of extremist movements rooted in exclusion.

We will inevitably go through several transitional phases, beginning with the overthrow of Syria’s totalitarian regime, which will open the door for confronting all forms of discrimination and authoritarianism in their various guises. Only then can we begin to build a flexible cultural model that reshapes individual and collective attitudes towards difference and fosters a culture of diversity. This would require a cultural-political programme dedicated to raising awareness across Arab societies.

**As a secular activist—and based on my reading of your writings—it is clear that your aspiration is for Syria to become a democratic, pluralistic, secular state. Yet the Syrian opposition often sidelines the Kurdish issue. While Burhan Ghalioun, as an intellectual and secularist, headed the Syrian National Council, the main opposition blocs are composed largely of Islamists. Can democracy be built through Islamist parties and movements?**

I strongly believe in the rights of the Kurdish people and all communities and individuals. I don’t think we can build a modern, humane Syrian state without addressing the historical injustices faced by the Kurdish people and restoring their full rights. Admittedly, the struggle remains long—it is a battle against a primitive legacy rooted in the rejection of the Other, stemming from deep-seated cultural anxiety.

However, I am confident that Syria is moving towards full recognition of the Kurdish people, including from the Muslim Brotherhood, who are compelled to align themselves with the demands of others in order to remain relevant and participate in governance. We saw this reflected in the final statement of the Syrian National Council, which acknowledged the rights of the Kurds and other components of Syrian society.

**When discussing Islamists in the Arab world, some people draw comparisons between Islamist parties in Arab countries and Turkey’s Justice and Development Party (AKP). Do you see any grounds for comparison?**

I don’t believe such comparisons are valid, as the Islamist movements in Arab countries have not experienced the same external and internal dynamics as Turkey. Turkey’s long-standing secularism created a framework that allowed its Islamist parties to evolve and gain the flexibility needed to govern and remain in power.

In contrast, Arab societies continue to perceive political Islam as a cure-all for their psychological, social, political and cultural woes. However, I believe that Islamist movements in the Arab world will eventually take a different path—one that compels them to become more accommodating of others in order to survive. The world at large has reached a turning point that demands change, and this shift will influence even the most rigid of Islamist movements, pushing them towards internal reform.

**A final question: what are Randa Kassis’s expectations for the future of the Arab Spring in general, and for the Syrian state and people in particular?**

I believe the Arab Spring will go through all four seasons. The process of change began when we reached ‘zero hour’—the moment when people rose up against their rulers. This transformation will not stop there; it will evolve into an intellectual revolution aimed at purging our dominant culture of its mental shackles and countless taboos.

The coming transitional phase—whether in Syria or across the Arab world—will undoubtedly be difficult. But I am filled with confidence and optimism. I believe we can dismantle the structures of despotism and the culture of erasure, and replace them with a concept of complementarity that values diversity, justice, and mutual recognition.
