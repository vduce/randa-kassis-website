<h4>The Diplomat’s In-Depth Interview with Randa Kassis (PART ONE)</h4>

Le Diplomate

By Roland Lombardi  

Randa Kassis, Franco-Syrian politician, writer, and President of the Movement for a Pluralistic Society, was the co-president of the secular and democratic Syrian opposition delegation at the Geneva talks. She initiated the Astana Platform in 2015, which has brought together Syrian opposition figures on multiple occasions. In this context, she has held repeated meetings with Russian, Turkish, Western, and Saudi leaders, among others.

In this exclusive interview with Le Diplomate Media, she offers a remarkably lucid—though at times troubling—assessment of the current state of the world, focusing in particular on two geo-civilisational spheres she has long studied and understands well: the Middle East and Near East on the one hand, and the Russia–West crisis and the Russo-Ukrainian war on the other. This interview will therefore be presented in two 'episodes': the first dedicated to the Middle and Near East, the second to the Russo-Ukrainian conflict.

<b>Randa Kassis, you closely follow geopolitical developments in the Near and Middle East through your work as a Syrian opposition figure seeking a way out of the crisis, and through your participation in numerous international conferences across the Arab world and Turkey. What was your reaction to the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran on 31 July—reportedly by an Israeli missile strike or possibly a bomb detonated on site?</b>

The targeted assassination of Ismail Haniyeh marks yet another step in regional escalation. The choice of target is rather peculiar, given that Haniyeh was one of the relatively moderate figures and was due to step down in less than a year. It appears to be an act of adventurism on Netanyahu’s part—particularly as striking Iran on its own soil is bound to provoke severe retaliation. Although Haniyeh was neither Shiite nor Iranian and is ultimately replaceable, and not a vital figure for Iran, the fact that he was assassinated on the very day of the new Iranian president’s inauguration—in the heart of Tehran, no less—means that a Palestinian leader was killed in a host country incapable of protecting its guest.

This represents an extraordinary humiliation for the mullahs, the Supreme Leader, the Iranian security services, the Revolutionary Guards, and the regime as a whole. As a result, Tehran will be compelled to retaliate. Netanyahu’s calculation strikes me as extremely risky. He will likely struggle to control the fallout in the coming weeks. In conclusion, it seems to reflect a headlong pursuit that avoids confronting the root causes.

<b>Given the close ties between the Syrian and Iranian regimes, do you believe Iran will manage to avoid direct war with Israel before achieving full nuclear capability?</b>

It appears that Iran is now very close to mastering nuclear weapons. It is highly likely that recent developments are only accelerating Iran’s acquisition of the bomb. Netanyahu’s recklessness is fuelling an escalation that could eventually lead to a full-scale regional war—although I do not believe such a conflict is imminent.

However, should there be an Israeli incursion into southern Lebanon, Hezbollah would likely attempt to contain the conflict within that area to avoid broader escalation. Such an incursion, in my view, would only strengthen Nasrallah against his internal detractors and once again bolster his image as a symbol of resistance in the Middle East. As for Syria, Bashar al-Assad has once again shown himself to be a hostage to the situation, with no real margin for manoeuvre. Between Iranian interests, Israeli reprisals, and the Russian presence in Syria, Bashar has opted to remain a marginal figure, entirely devoid of autonomy.

<b>How do you assess the situation in Gaza? Have the Abraham Accords been jeopardised? The recent expressions of de facto solidarity with Israel from the UAE, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia during the Iranian attack would suggest otherwise…</b>

I would be cautious in assuming the existence of a united coalition against Iran, for several reasons. Saudi Arabia has clearly stated that the establishment of both an Israeli and a Palestinian state is a prerequisite for any normalisation with Israel. I do not believe Riyadh is prepared to seriously jeopardise its currently stable relations with Tehran. As for Jordan, it is the most fragile country in the region, and its king could well become a victim of a proxy conflict. It is not inconceivable that Tehran might attempt to destabilise Jordan to the point of threatening the monarchy. Time will tell whether the Abraham Accords are truly robust. At present, the situation has slipped beyond Netanyahu’s control, and he is increasingly playing the role of an inciter.

<b>What about Syria, your country of origin, which the media barely mention any more except in the context of Israeli airstrikes? How is the regime managing to survive under international sanctions and the US-imposed ban on reconstruction (Caesar Act)?</b>

Sadly, Syria has become a narco-state. The regime’s primary source of income now stems from drug trafficking—particularly captagon and methamphetamine. Any hope of meaningful reconstruction is illusory. Who would fund it? Certainly not Saudi Arabia, Iran, Russia, or even China. Civilians living in regime-held areas are fleeing the country. Young people are doing everything they can to escape. If no political solution is found in the coming years, Assad’s territories will be inhabited solely by the elderly and drug traffickers. More than 90% of the population lives below the poverty line. At this point, expecting any genuine change is unrealistic. Nevertheless, we must continue our struggle in order to initiate a real political process.

<b>Do you believe, as some do, that Daesh has not had its final word in Syria, and that jihadism (like political Islamism) still poses a threat to Bashar al-Assad’s regime, despite the defeats of ISIS in 2017–2018?</b>

It is true that ISIS cells remain active in Syria, and it is entirely possible they could be reactivated. However, I doubt they will ever regain their former strength. I believe the real threat to the Syrian regime lies with its own allies, who are growing increasingly frustrated with its political manoeuvrings. Iran, for instance, is displeased with the regime’s failure to honour its commitments. Moreover, Assad is attempting a questionable rapprochement with Saudi Arabia and has remained largely passive during the current Middle East crisis—further deepening Tehran’s mistrust. As for the Russians, they are frustrated by the regime’s intransigence and its complete lack of engagement in any political process or constitutional reform.
