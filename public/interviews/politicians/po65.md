ASTANA (Sputnik) – Members of the Syrian opposition signed a final declaration on Sunday following two days of intensive negotiations at the conference held in the Kazakh capital, Astana, a RIA Novosti correspondent reported.

On Saturday, a source close to the talks indicated that the declaration would omit any assessment of the Russian Air Force’s military operation against the Islamic State (ISIL) terrorist group, which began on Wednesday in Syria at the request of President Bashar al-Assad.

The issue of Russian airstrikes sparked heated debate during the conference, with participants ultimately failing to reach a consensus.

The Astana-2 conference, held from 2 to 4 October, brought together Syrian opposition groups to discuss the transition of power in Syria, the parliamentary elections scheduled for 2016, the fight against terrorism, and the ongoing civil war.

At the previous conference in May, Syrian opposition groups signed a document calling for the withdrawal of all foreign mercenaries from Syria and underscored the need to form a united front against terrorism.

Syria has been engulfed in civil war since 2011. The government is engaged in conflict with various opposition forces, as well as extremist Islamist groups including the Nusra Front and ISIL.
