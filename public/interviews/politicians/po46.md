The head of the Astana platform of the Syrian opposition, Randa Kassis, stated on Wednesday that she is currently in Kazakhstan to meet with Foreign Minister Kairat Abdrakhmanov. She clarified, however, that she is not participating in the Astana meetings, as she does not represent any military faction, emphasising that the talks are focused on military parties.

Kassis told Rudaw Media Network: 'The delay in the meeting, which was scheduled to begin today, is due to disagreements among the military factions and the Riyadh platform (the High Negotiations Committee)', adding that 'Kazakhstan has made significant efforts to pave the way for the meeting to be held once again'.

She explained that the Astana meetings between the military factions and the Syrian regime appear to be making progress on the military track.

The Syrian opposition figure also noted that she is 'not optimistic about the Geneva IV conference, scheduled to take place on the 23rd of this month under the auspices of the UN envoy to Syria, Staffan de Mistura'.
