**Randa Kassis’ Interview** _LBC TV_ 1 March 2017

**Summary:**

In an exclusive interview broadcast on 1 March 2017 by LBC, Randa Kassis, President of the Astana Platform within the Syrian opposition, delivered a scathing assessment of the Geneva IV peace talks, bluntly stating that the negotiations concerning the Syrian file had failed. She asserted that the most crucial step at this stage was the departure of UN Special Envoy Staffan de Mistura, whom she described as a major obstacle to any genuine progress.

Kassis’s remarks reflected her broader frustration with the fragmented nature of the Syrian opposition’s representation in Geneva. The inconsistent and uncoordinated invitations extended to opposition platforms, she argued, undermined both the legitimacy and effectiveness of the talks. She expressed particular discontent over the exclusion of the Astana Platform—despite Russia’s firm insistence on the inclusion of all major opposition groups—blaming de Mistura for what she viewed as a selective and detrimental approach.

She also criticised the weakness of the participating figures, noting that even formerly influential platforms such as Moscow and Cairo had lost much of their sway. This, she contended, further contributed to the ineffectiveness of the Geneva IV process.

Kassis described the negotiations as “cooking stones”—a Syrian metaphor for a futile and time-consuming endeavour with no foreseeable outcome. Her conclusion was unequivocal: as long as de Mistura remained in his post, genuine political progress would be unattainable.

She further hinted at new political initiatives being developed in coordination with Moscow and supported by influential international actors, suggesting that alternative avenues may soon emerge to address the Syrian crisis more effectively.
