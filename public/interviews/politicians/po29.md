**The Limits of Influence: Washington, Astana, and the Future of Syria** _RT Arabic_ 11 December 2018 Guests: Ahmad Rahhal & Randa Kassis

**Summary:**

In a detailed discussion on the future of the Astana Process and the broader Syrian settlement, Randa Kassis contended that the United States lacks both the political instruments and strategic leverage to dismantle either the Astana or Sochi tracks. As Washington had not participated in these frameworks nor proposed a viable alternative, she characterised its threats to undermine them as mere rhetoric. She further emphasised the failure of the Geneva Process, asserting that it had proven ineffective and that no substantive political outcome could emerge from it. According to Kassis, only the Astana and Sochi tracks have produced tangible results—most notably, the proposal to establish a constitutional committee—thus offering the most realistic foundation for progress.

Ahmad Rahhal, by contrast, assigned responsibility for obstructing the Astana agreements to Russia and Iran, citing their failure to uphold ceasefires, release detainees, or facilitate humanitarian access. He noted that the regime had persistently undermined negotiations, whether in Geneva or Astana, and accused Staffan de Mistura, the outgoing UN envoy, of prolonging a fruitless process. Nevertheless, Rahhal regarded James Jeffrey, the U.S. envoy, as a potential mediator rather than a saboteur, arguing that Jeffrey sought to coordinate various international efforts rather than dismantle existing frameworks.

Both participants addressed the deadlock surrounding the formation of the constitutional committee. Kassis criticised the formula proposed by de Mistura—dividing membership equally among the regime, the opposition, and civil society—as unworkable and unrepresentative. She advocated a reconfiguration that would ensure parity between the regime and a broadly inclusive opposition, incorporating figures beyond the current negotiating entities such as the High Negotiations Committee or the Syrian National Coalition. She also rejected the notion that UN mediators should play a role in selecting committee members, maintaining that this responsibility should rest solely with Syrians.

The discussion also touched on Turkey’s strategic role. While recognising Ankara’s centrality to the Syrian file, both Kassis and Rahhal highlighted growing tensions between Turkey and the United States, particularly over Kurdish forces in northeastern Syria and the S-400 missile system. Kassis expressed scepticism regarding the U.S.’s ability to alter Turkey’s role within the Astana framework, citing enduring disagreements and conflicting priorities.

Despite their differing emphases, both interlocutors concurred that the current opposition remains fragmented and ineffectual. They underscored the urgent need for a cohesive, pragmatic opposition bloc capable of engaging in meaningful political dialogue with the regime. Without such a bloc—and in the absence of international consensus—any political track, whether Geneva, Astana, or Sochi, is likely to falter.
