**Syria: The Great Blindness** _France 2 – Un Œil sur la Planète_ 18 February 2016

**Summary:**

A former member of the Syrian National Council (SNC), now living in exile, offers a candid account of the Council’s early trajectory. She asserts that from its inception, the SNC functioned less as a genuinely inclusive political body and more as a vehicle for advancing the interests of Islamist factions—particularly those aligned with the Muslim Brotherhood. According to her, the Council’s internal dynamics were deeply problematic: many of its members lacked political sophistication, ideological clarity, and educational grounding. She describes them as individuals propelled into leadership roles without the requisite qualifications, often driven by sectarian or ideological motives rather than a sincere commitment to pluralism or national unity.

She recalls that some members openly expressed their desire for an Islamist Syria—an ambition that closely mirrored the expectations of their regional sponsors. Behind the scenes, she explains, the Muslim Brotherhood was already executing a strategic plan to infiltrate and dominate the Council from within. This infiltration was anything but subtle; it was systematic and, in some cases, openly acknowledged. Although a number of opposition figures were aware of this agenda and attempted to raise the alarm, their voices were either drowned out or deliberately sidelined by those complicit or indifferent.

Randa Kassis, who stood firmly against the growing influence of Islamist ideologies within the Council, refused to compromise her stance. Her clear and vocal opposition to the Muslim Brotherhood’s manoeuvres increasingly placed her at odds with the prevailing leadership. In time, this led to her unceremonious dismissal from the Syrian National Council—a move she believes was prompted by her principled resistance to the Council’s ideological drift. Her account sheds light on the early fractures within the Syrian opposition and reveals the extent to which ideological infiltration undermined the promise of a unified, secular alternative to the Assad regime.
