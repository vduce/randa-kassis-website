<h4>The Russia–Turkey Agreement on Northeastern Syria Will Not Be Implemented</h4>

With steadfast determination and perseverance, Randa Kassis, President of the Astana Platform, continues to distinguish herself within the Syrian political landscape. She presents a clear and inclusive vision for resolving the Syrian crisis through a comprehensive constitutional framework that embraces all stakeholders—excluding neither individuals, parties, nor ethnic groups. Her vision is rooted in the conviction that Syria’s deeply embedded pluralism must form the cornerstone of a new constitution, one that guarantees equality, justice, and fundamental freedoms.

<b>As the Constitutional Committee begins its work, what is your view of the content of the future Syrian constitution?</b>

Before examining the content, we must question the very legitimacy and capacity of this committee to effect meaningful constitutional change. President Bashar al-Assad, regime-aligned media, and the participating government delegation have repeatedly asserted that the delegation does not officially represent the Syrian government, but is merely supported by it. This subtle distinction enables the regime to evade any binding commitments made by the Committee.

Despite this clear manipulation, the UN Special Envoy for Syria, Geir Pedersen, failed to raise any objections or seek clarification. It appears he is participating in this process in the hope of claiming a symbolic 'success' for his record, possibly as a stepping stone to future roles in the private sector. The United Nations, desperate to showcase any form of peace—however superficial—continues to grasp at illusions, particularly after its repeated failures in managing other crises.

<b>In 2017, you initiated meetings with Syrian and international experts to form a constitutional committee—an initiative that later became international. Why did you choose this path in your pursuit of a solution?</b>

In 2015, I appealed to President Nursultan Nazarbayev with a request to convene Syrian opposition factions in Astana, with the goal of establishing a political platform in the Kazakh capital. Following several rounds of dialogue, we agreed on a number of key decisions, including the need to draft a new Syrian constitution. Accordingly, in 2017, the Astana Platform invited Syrian and international experts, alongside various Syrian stakeholders, to collaboratively work on forming a constitutional committee. The intention was to revive a stagnant political process, particularly in light of the failure of the United Nations and its former envoy, Staffan de Mistura, during Geneva IV.

We were convinced of the need for clear constitutional provisions that would secure rights and ensure equality for all citizens, in contrast to the current Syrian constitution. Politically, this also aligned with our objective to implement one of the resolutions adopted in Astana: to draft a modern constitution that reflects Syria’s historical and cultural diversity.

We aimed to develop a practical and inclusive draft constitution. Article 2 of the Astana draft, for instance, defines Syria as the common and indivisible homeland of all Syrians, while recognising the right of autonomous regions to organise their own institutions. However, the State would retain exclusive authority in matters relating to international relations, naturalisation and immigration laws, justice, finance, defence, and similar domains.

Article 7 promotes education for all, rejects legal provisions that restrict individual freedoms or undermine guarantees, and holds public authorities accountable. It prohibits any repressive acts by state bodies and any discrimination based on place of birth, ethnicity, religion, political views, or personal and social circumstances. It also grants every Syrian adult the unrestricted right to choose their personal status laws. Furthermore, it affirms the right of any Syrian—whether residing in the country or abroad—to stand for public office. A dedicated chapter also addresses the relationship between the government and parliament, outlining the separation of powers within a mixed system.

<b>What has become of these constitutional principles? Why have they not been implemented?</b>

A significant number of Astana Platform members participated in the Sochi Conference as part of our delegation. I personally served on the conference’s presidency. We voiced our demands clearly, and I emphasised the urgent need to establish a constitutional committee. We succeeded in that endeavour.

However, once the initiative came under UN supervision, it quickly devolved into a mechanism for delay, undermining the original vision for genuine reform in Syria. The process now seems to serve the interests of the Syrian regime, which categorically rejects any gradual transition. In such circumstances, it is imperative that we consider new initiatives capable of catalysing real change.

<b>How can a new constitution be drafted when the war continues and there is no tangible progress on the ground? Would it not have been better to resolve the ongoing conflict first?</b>

It is extremely unlikely that the Syrian regime will accept any constitution produced by this committee—even assuming that committee members manage to reach consensus on some fundamental points, which itself is doubtful. Syrian officials and regime media have consistently declared that the Geneva delegation does not represent them, but merely enjoys their support. This carefully worded stance allows them to repudiate any resulting agreements later on.

At most, the regime might agree to superficial amendments to non-essential provisions. As for the situation on the ground, I do not foresee any real stabilisation in northeastern Syria. On the contrary, I expect continued cycles of escalation and de-escalation for the foreseeable future.

<b>What is the situation of the Kurds under this constitution, especially in light of their deteriorating position?</b>

I do not believe the Committee is in a position to effect any meaningful change on the ground. The Kurds have lost nothing by abstaining from these meetings. However, the situation unfolding in northeastern Syria is deeply troubling—the erosion of a secular and autonomous model that once stood as a rare example of inclusive governance.

This model of self-administration and cultural diversity is crucial for the future of a democratic Syria. A viable solution for Syria is impossible without the active participation of all its communities. Excluding any group from the political process undermines the very foundation of peace and national unity.

<b>Given the continuing conflict in northern Syria—and in light of both the Russia–Turkey agreement and the Russian-brokered deal between the Kurds and the regime—do you see any possibility of an end to the crisis in the north?</b>

No, certainly not. These agreements will not be implemented. The parties involved have divergent, often conflicting, interests. At the same time, none of them has an interest in revealing the full extent of their role or intentions.

In particular, the Russia–Turkey agreement must be viewed through the lens of history. A review of relations between Turkey and Russia—from the Ottoman and Tsarist eras to the present—reveals that this is not a strategic alliance built for the long term.

<b>In light of escalating tensions and the UN’s ongoing failure to produce a viable political solution, what do you believe is the way out of this impasse?</b>

I firmly believe that perseverance and sustained efforts to develop new initiatives will eventually bear fruit and bring about change in Syria, even if this requires time. History has shown that regimes which stubbornly cling to power and refuse reform ultimately collapse, even if the process is long and painful.

I remain convinced that one of these initiatives will eventually succeed—provided we continue to focus on realistic solutions and build a genuine foundation for change in Syria.
