<h4>Brussels Will Soon Be Hosting a Terrorist</h4>

**Summary:**

In her stark and provocative statement, “Brussels will soon be hosting a terrorist,” Syrian secular politician Randa Kassis issues a grave warning about the potential political and moral consequences of Western engagement with extremist figures emerging from the Syrian conflict. Her declaration is not merely rhetorical, but reflects a broader critique of what she sees as a recurring pattern in European policy—namely, the legitimisation or tacit acceptance of radical Islamist individuals under the pretext of diplomacy, humanitarianism, or geopolitical pragmatism.

Kassis, known for her consistent opposition to both the Assad regime and jihadist factions such as Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), draws attention to the alarming possibility that the European Union—and Belgium in particular—may be on the verge of welcoming an individual deeply implicated in the ideological and violent machinery of terrorism. Her statement is laced with frustration at what she perceives as the West’s selective blindness and its repeated failure to distinguish between genuine representatives of political opposition and those who have promoted extremism under the guise of resistance.

By invoking Brussels—the symbolic heart of European governance—Kassis is not only addressing Belgian authorities, but issuing a broader warning to European institutions as a whole. She implicitly questions the ethical and strategic soundness of offering asylum, platforms, or negotiating legitimacy to individuals whose ideologies stand in stark contrast to the values of secularism, human rights, and democratic governance.

The gravity of her words lies in their challenge to Europe’s current handling of the Syrian dossier. For Kassis, the line between defending human rights and enabling ideological extremism has become dangerously blurred. Her warning is thus a call for greater discernment, stricter ethical standards, and a firmer stance against any form of political accommodation with figures whose pasts are tainted by violence and whose visions for the future stand in opposition to the liberal democratic order.

In sum, her statement encapsulates Randa Kassis’s broader political philosophy: an unyielding defence of secularism, an unequivocal rejection of extremism in all its forms, and a refusal to accept that short-term geopolitical gains should come at the expense of long-term societal security and moral clarity.
