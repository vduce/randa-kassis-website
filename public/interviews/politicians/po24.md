**Deadly Escalation Between Syrian and Turkish Force** _RT France_ 11 February 2020

**Summary:**

In this incisive analysis, Randa Kassis offers a sobering assessment of the evolving conflict in Syria, with particular emphasis on the intensifying hostilities in Idlib province. She presents the confrontation between the Syrian army, Turkish forces, and various rebel factions as symptomatic of a broader geopolitical breakdown—most notably, the collapse of the Sochi agreement. Once heralded as a framework for de-escalation, the accord is now, in her view, effectively void, as Russia and Turkey pursue increasingly incompatible agendas, marred by divergent strategic interests and conflicting definitions of terrorism.

Kassis contends that Turkey’s persistent military incursions into northern Syria—under the pretext of supporting opposition forces and securing regional influence—have not only failed to produce stability but have exacerbated the crisis. These actions, she argues, amount to a strategic blunder that has intensified the conflict and further alienated Ankara from Moscow. The alliance between the two powers is described as tenuous and transactional, held together less by mutual trust than by expediency and the absence of better alternatives.

Turning to the internal dynamics of the Syrian conflict, Kassis underscores the regime’s uncompromising pursuit of territorial reconquest—bolstered by Russian support and driven by a military-first doctrine that leaves little room for genuine political engagement. The constitutional committee, ostensibly designed to foster dialogue and reform, is dismissed as a hollow exercise—divorced from the realities on the ground and incapable of bringing about substantive change.

Kassis is equally critical of the United Nations, whose role, she suggests, has been reduced to that of a passive humanitarian agency—lacking both the authority and the political will to shape outcomes in Syria. In her estimation, the international community’s failure to exert meaningful influence has rendered a diplomatic resolution increasingly implausible.

She concludes with a stark warning: the mounting friction between Turkey and Russia not only threatens to unravel what remains of their cooperation, but also evokes older patterns of historical rivalry. Absent a decisive shift in international strategy, she sees no prospect for de-escalation—let alone a sustainable political settlement.
