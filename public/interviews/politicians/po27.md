**Neither Russia nor Turkey Has the Resources to Combat the Jihadist** _RT France_ 24 October 2019

**Summary:**

Randa Kassis, President of the Astana Platform and author of Syria and the Return of Russia, delivers a critical assessment of the evolving geopolitical landscape in north-eastern Syria. She denounces the abandonment of the Kurds and other minority groups as a profound moral and strategic failure on the part of Western leadership—one that has not only emboldened jihadist factions, but also exacerbated the region’s humanitarian crisis. Kassis contends that recent Russian-Turkish agreements fall short of offering genuine stability, highlighting the fragility of arrangements that neither party possesses the resources nor the sustained political will to enforce effectively.

The Turkish military incursion is described unequivocally as a violation of Syrian sovereignty, driven by President Erdoğan’s broader, unfulfilled ambitions. Kassis casts serious doubt on Ankara’s commitment to existing accords, citing historical patterns of Turkish unilateralism and disregard for international obligations. While she acknowledges Russia’s protective stance towards minorities, she remains sceptical of its capacity to ensure meaningful, long-term security, given the persistent complexity of Syria’s internal conflict and the enduring threat posed by jihadist elements—many of whom have escaped detention in the wake of military withdrawals.

Ultimately, Kassis paints a bleak picture of Syria’s immediate future—one marked by protracted conflict, fragile diplomatic manoeuvring, and continued displacement. She underscores the geopolitical chess game being played at the expense of vulnerable populations, warning that neither Russian pragmatism nor Turkish assertiveness offers a durable solution. The interview stands as a stark reminder of the limits of international agreements when confronted with deep-rooted regional ambitions, historical mistrust, and the enduring vacuum of effective humanitarian intervention.
