<h4>From Syrian Chaos to Libyan Chaos – Exclusive Interview with Randa Kassis</h4>

By Alexandre del Valle  

To take stock of the situations in Syria and Libya—where not only Turkish neo-Ottoman expansionism is unfolding, but also broader geopolitical rivalries between major regional and global powers—Alexandre del Valle spoke with Randa Kassis, President of the “Astana Platform” and a Syrian political figure involved in the political process since its inception. These rivalries have fuelled civil wars, resulting in an almost intractable state of chaos.

Following the ceasefire agreement reached between Moscow and Ankara on 5 March—aimed at “sharing” control over the Idlib region (the last stronghold of anti-Assad Islamist rebels and international jihadists, mainly affiliated with Al-Qaeda/HTS, formerly al-Nusra)—Syria remains a deeply weakened and fragmented country, prey to the ambitions of foreign powers. These powers have proven more effective at maintaining a status quo than achieving an “inclusive political solution”—a goal made all the more elusive by the fact that the “wars within the war” (the regime versus the rebels; Islamists and jihadists versus the Kurds, and minorities versus the Sunni Arab majority, etc.) are far from over.

No one, moreover, is willing or able to finance reconstruction—something obstructed by the Americans through the Caesar Act. The “alliance” of realpolitik between Iran and Russia (pro-regime) and Turkey (pro-rebels) is more accurately described as an “understanding built on disagreements” rather than a genuine partnership.

As for the Assad regime, it remains bankrupt, fragmented, and highly fragile, despite acquiring Russian S-400 anti-aircraft missile systems. The Islamist and jihadist rebels, along with the unpredictable Kurdish separatists—who have become temporary allies of the regime in the face of the shared Turkish threat—are unlikely to relinquish their territories easily, particularly in the case of the Kurdish “Rojava”, which comprises around one-fifth of Syrian territory. This region was gained in the northeast during the fight against Daesh and is now held in defiance of Turkish forces and their Islamist auxiliaries.

As for the “Libyan chaos”, it increasingly mirrors the Syrian one: Russians and Turks confront one another via proxy militias and mercenaries, while the sponsors of both camps—Russia, Egypt, France, and the UAE backing Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar, who controls Cyrenaica; and Qatar and Turkey supporting the Muslim Brotherhood-affiliated official government of Tripoli led by Fayez al-Sarraj—supply arms and aerial support in blatant violation of the UN arms embargo.

Just as in Syria, where Chechens fought on both sides (pro-Assad loyalist Chechens backed by Russia, and anti-Russian jihadist Chechens affiliated with Daesh), in Libya too, pro-Assad Syrian auxiliaries recruited by Moscow now fight alongside Haftar’s forces (anti-Muslim Brotherhood), together with African and Russian mercenaries from the Wagner Group.

Meanwhile, Ankara has deployed Islamist Syrian proxies to support the Muslim Brotherhood-aligned government of al-Sarraj in Tripoli.

Conversely, it is worth recalling that leading figures of Libya’s Islamist revolution—those responsible for the assassination of Muammar Gaddafi—such as the infamous Abdelhakim Belhadj, later appointed “Military Governor of Tripoli”, had supported Syria’s Islamist rebellion nearly a decade earlier.

In early June, as Haftar laid siege to Tripoli after taking Sirte and vowed to seize control of all Libya with backing from the Tobruk-based parliament, Turkish military assistance pushed back his forces, who not only failed to capture Tripoli but also lost control of Sirte. Emmanuel Macron, for his part, recently accused Turkish President Erdoğan of playing a “dangerous game” in Libya. Paris claims that Turkey has been massively supplying arms to the Government of National Accord (GNA) in Tripoli, in violation of the UN embargo—a breach committed, it must be said, by all parties and their respective backers.

Turkey, in turn, accuses France of supporting Haftar, the self-proclaimed and “illegitimate” leader of Cyrenaica, who is backed by the UAE and Egypt—both of which are firmly engaged in a regional war against the Muslim Brotherhood and its Turkish-Qatari protectors. Most notably, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi—Erdoğan’s personal nemesis and a staunch opponent of neo-Ottoman, pro-Brotherhood Turkish expansionism (and of Turkish ambitions over gas fields)—recently warned that “any advance by pro-GNA forces towards Sirte (450 km east of Tripoli) would trigger a ‘direct’ intervention from Cairo…”

<b>Randa Kassis, what is your current assessment of the war in Syria?</b>

To summarise: as you know, on 23 September 2019, a “Constitutional Committee” was established, supposedly bringing together the Syrian regime and the opposition under the auspices of the United Nations and its special envoy, Geir Pedersen. This committee comprises 50 representatives from the Syrian government, 50 from the opposition, and 50 Syrian citizens appointed by the UN. Its stated aim was to stabilise the country and draft a new constitution that would enable free elections, with international backing.

In reality, the project has led nowhere. It was completely paralysed due to Bashar al-Assad’s intransigence and the lack of goodwill from the Islamist opposition. It’s true that after months of lockdown—during which the Syrian dossier was also put on hold—there was talk of resuming the Committee’s work, supposedly as early as August. But I do not believe in its success, especially since Mr Pedersen has simply repeated the same failed approach from the outset.

I have no expectations for this committee. Another key point, in my view, is that with the implementation of the Caesar Act, it is clear that Assad’s regime cannot endure—despite nominally controlling “65% of Syrian territory”. That figure is highly relative, as unresolved issues with Sunni Islamist rebels and jihadists persist, not to mention the unresolved Kurdish question and even deep internal rifts within the regime itself—particularly between Rami Makhlouf, Bashar al-Assad, and his wife Asma. Add to that Assad’s unpopularity within his own Alawite community… Furthermore, the tightening of economic sanctions under the US Caesar Act punishes any company attempting to do business in Syria under Assad’s rule. The result is catastrophic—a “status quo of the worst kind”. To be blunt, there’s nothing left in Syria but ruins. Assad will neither be able to unify the country nor facilitate a genuine political process. In fact, no political process is possible while he remains in power—his continued presence blocks it entirely in a desperate bid to cling to his post.

<b>Precisely on that point—what about reconstruction in the context of the Caesar Act, which you’ve just mentioned? Who would dare foot the bill, knowing they risk incurring the wrath of the US Treasury, which sanctions any business or country investing in Syria as long as Assad remains in power?</b>

Let me remind you that this law sanctions, for the first time, Asma al-Assad herself—described as “one of Syria’s most notorious war profiteers”. It deals a serious blow to the Syrian establishment and comes amid a deepening economic crisis. The Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act, signed into law by the US President last December, has now come into effect—and its consequences are severe. The announcement of a sanctions list targeting regime-aligned individuals and companies will place Damascus under unsustainable pressure. The law particularly targets anyone supporting the state in key economic sectors related to reconstruction, oil, and gas. What does this mean in practical terms? The Russians and Iranians, despite being Assad’s allies, do not have the financial capacity to undertake Syria’s reconstruction. As for China—the only power theoretically capable of defying US extraterritorial sanctions—it does not view Syria as a strategic priority.

This financing dilemma is the real thorn in the side of those, like the Russians, who claim to support a political solution in Syria. That solution remains impossible so long as Bashar al-Assad and his inner circle stay in power. Even the few countries that had tentatively considered investing a few months ago have now been thoroughly dissuaded by the Caesar Act, which, as with Iran, heavily penalises any business operating in Syria.

Unless there is at least a partial change—not necessarily a radical one, but one that includes Assad’s departure—the situation will remain completely blocked. Assad’s determination to cling to power at all costs prevents any political resolution and, by extension, any chance of reconstruction. That is the tragedy.

Let me say it again: for nine years, since the start of the war, Assad has demonstrated his utter incapacity to implement even the most minimal reform—even gradual.

<b>That said, as a patriotic Syrian political figure who remains deeply attached to your country, are you not troubled by the Caesar Act’s impact on the Syrian people—already impoverished, driven into exile, and deprived of everything, including the hope of reconstruction and economic recovery?</b>

I support the Caesar Act, even if, regrettably, it seems to worsen the people’s suffering. But allow me to explain why, in reality, the opposite is true.

As long as Bashar remains at the helm of the regime, no change will ever be possible in Syria, and the civil war will never be resolved. This law, which strikes at the very heart of power, sends a clear signal to Damascus’s allies: the time has come to prepare for the post-Assad era. His continued presence is the primary obstacle to both a political settlement and even a military resolution to the crisis. Everything is frozen—paralysed by his grip on power. Sadly, some within Russia still fail to grasp the need for a realistic process—one that Assad is entirely unfit to lead. Certain elements of the Russian establishment, particularly those shaped by a Soviet-era mentality, are incapable of recognising this. But others, more modern and pragmatic, understand it all too well.

Let me reiterate: the person inflicting the greatest suffering on the Syrian people is Bashar al-Assad himself. Of course, no one wants to see a repeat of the Iraqi scenario. But if we are to push for a political solution, the Caesar Act may serve as a useful instrument. It guarantees that there can be no way forward except through change—through a transition away from a figure I would describe as autistic, tragically propped up by his equally obstinate Iranian backers and certain inflexible factions within the Russian establishment, even if others are far more realistic.

In my view, the Caesar Act will compel certain actors—particularly within the Russian camp who are less “Soviet” in outlook—to accept the conditions required for a genuine political alternative.

<b>What is the current situation regarding the Kurdish region of Rojava in the north, and its relations with the loyalist government, in the context of Turkish military interventions and their Islamist proxies, which have forced hundreds of thousands of Kurds to flee from the north-west?</b>

The Kurds are fighting for their place—for their survival and their interests—and I have supported them since the very beginning of the Syrian crisis, within the framework of a federal state project. However, such a solution must arise from dialogue among Syrians themselves—and that dialogue is entirely absent with the Damascus regime.

Despite appearances, the regime is not truly allied with the Kurds. What we are witnessing is a temporary and superficial non-aggression pact, born out of a shared enemy: Turkish irredentism. But the Kurdish question remains far from resolved.

Since the Turkish military incursions, relations between the Kurds and the regime may have improved marginally, but the leadership in Damascus remains wedded to the use of force. They would rather preserve the current deadlock than adopt a pragmatic and open stance to offer the Kurds any form of meaningful autonomy. Furthermore, the Kurdish separatists of the YPG/SDF have, at times, overstepped. At the height of their military strength—after liberating vast areas in eastern and north-western Syria from Daesh—they attempted to gain access to the Mediterranean. This provoked panic in Ankara, which responded with extreme violence.

<b>Is Ankara still playing a dangerous game in the north-west, maintaining its alliance with Islamist and jihadist forces—an alliance shaped by their shared hostility towards the Kurds, particularly the PKK, their long-standing enemy?</b>

Turkey’s pro-Islamist strategy—acting as patron of the Arab Muslim Brotherhood, at times offering indirect support to Daesh, and now openly backing jihadist legions affiliated with Al-Qaeda in the Idlib region—is no secret. This policy is primarily driven by Ankara’s fight against the separatist Kurdish PKK. It is well known that President Erdoğan, who has long toyed with Islamist factions, continues to do so for both geopolitical and ideological reasons—his worldview remains firmly rooted in Islamism.

Erdoğan’s military strategy against the Kurds is consistent—whether in Syria, Turkey, or Iraq, where recent Turkish airstrikes have targeted PKK positions, compensating for losses incurred during successive Turkish military operations in Syria (“Euphrates Shield”, “Olive Branch”, and “Peace Spring”). Erdoğan’s obsession, though strategically coherent, is not with suppressing all Kurds—his relations with anti-PKK Kurdish groups in Iraq remain relatively cordial—but specifically with weakening those linked to the Syrian Kurdish forces, themselves affiliated with the Turkish PKK.

I believe Turkey remains capable of supplying arms to Arab and Turkmen Islamist factions fighting their common enemy: the anti-Islamist, separatist Kurdish forces of the YPG and Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). It is evident that these Arab and Turkic-speaking Islamist militias—recently supported by Ankara to dislodge Kurdish fighters—are themselves closely aligned with Al-Qaeda. This is an open secret, and a brutally cynical geopolitical reality. As for Daesh, its presence in Syria has been reduced to a residual threat. While Ankara may have facilitated its operations between 2014 and 2016, that is no longer the case. I do not believe Daesh’s legions will ever regain the strength they once had between 2014 and 2017—not in Syria.

<b>Let’s now turn to Turkish activism in Libya. Are there visible links between Syrian Islamist militias and their counterparts in western Libya, particularly those supporting the Muslim Brotherhood-aligned government in Tripoli?</b>

The chaos in Libya does indeed bear several parallels with that of Syria, including numerous overlaps—though the sociological and ethno-religious contexts differ considerably.

Again, it is no secret that thousands of Syrian and Turkmen Islamist fighters—drawn from the western Syrian theatre—have been deployed to Libya by Erdoğan’s government to support Islamist forces aligned with Fayez al-Sarraj. Sarraj, backed by Turkey, is opposed by General Haftar, who is supported by the rival Tobruk-based parliament and its foreign backers: the Emiratis, Russians, Egyptians, and the French.

<b>What is Erdoğan’s ultimate objective? Is he seeking to restore the Ottoman Empire, or is this simply a case of neo-colonial Turkish irredentism? On 22 December 2019, in Gölcük, he declared: “We are often asked what we are doing in Libya. We are there to defend our descendants, our Anatolian brothers.” In your view, how is Turkey managing its “alliance” with Russia, which supports the opposing side? Are the two countries more aligned in Syria than in Libya?</b>

Behind all the ideology—be it Islamism, grand declarations about “brothers” descended from Anatolian Turks, or talk of “neo-Ottomanism”—Erdoğan is, above all, a pragmatic and power-driven leader seeking access to Africa. Geographically, Libya offers the most strategic gateway to the continent. It provides access to the Maghreb, Sub-Saharan Africa, and the southern Mediterranean. Erdoğan is pursuing military, political, and economic footholds there. Through Libya, he aims to broker trade agreements with African nations. His bold and calculated objective is to position Turkey as a global actor capable of projecting influence across multiple regions simultaneously. Does Erdoğan see Turkey as the next Russia or United States? It seems clear that he sees opportunity in the geopolitical vacuums of Syria and Libya—opportunities to expand Turkey’s influence across the Middle East, the Arab world, and Africa.

That said, one must not overlook the domestic agenda. Turkish-Islamist expansionism—in Syria, the Mediterranean (with its contested gas reserves off Greek and Arab coasts, the Cyprus issue, and the Aegean islands), and Libya (with its oil and gateway to Africa)—also serves Erdoğan’s internal ambitions. As with his rhetorical defence of the Palestinians, this strategy is an effective domestic tool to bolster his leadership, especially following his party’s loss of control in Istanbul and Ankara. As is often the case—in Russia, the United States, or even France—foreign adventures and external conflicts can reinforce domestic power and marginalise opposition. Erdoğan, through his assertion of international “greatness”, seeks to cement Turkey’s status as a regional power and to consolidate his personal hold on power.

<b>But hasn’t this expansionist policy isolated Ankara from most of its neighbours? Isn’t Erdoğan playing a dangerous game? Could this not lead to war with Egypt or Greece—especially as those two countries have grown closer in recent months?</b>

A war between Erdoğan’s Turkey and al-Sisi’s Egypt? I don’t believe so. Cairo simply lacks the strength to confront Ankara. Egypt has not even managed to halt Ethiopia’s construction of dams that are reducing the Nile’s flow downstream… The Egyptian military is not particularly formidable, and Greece’s armed forces are no match for Turkey’s either. I don’t foresee any truly effective Greco-Egyptian military alliance, even if one were to be formalised against Turkey.

In fact, the Greeks are deeply concerned that any military confrontation could give Erdoğan a pretext to seize islands in the Aegean. Is Erdoğan playing a clever game? Yes, without doubt. He is a politically astute and strategically persistent leader. But whether he will ultimately succeed is far from certain.

In my view, Ankara’s—and Erdoğan’s—error may lie in overreach: trying to play too many hands at once and making too many enemies simultaneously. Beyond Greece, many Arab states today stand firmly opposed to Turkey and its expansionist ambitions. As for the Turkish-Russian “partnership”, it remains fragile at best. Certainly, both sides need each other. But their fundamental disagreements could cause the alliance to fracture at any time.

<b>Let’s return to Field Marshal Haftar in Libya, who recently suffered a major setback against western Islamist forces backed by Turkey and their proxies. Is he “finished”, as some media have hastily claimed—particularly now that he no longer controls the entire oil crescent?</b>

Let’s not forget that Haftar still controls around 65% of Libyan territory. I don’t believe he’s on the verge of losing the entire country. Even if he fails to retake all of Libya or to defeat al-Sarraj’s forces in the west, he will remain a central figure in a de facto partition—a reality already tacitly acknowledged by Russia, Turkey, and several other regional and international actors. Regarding the oil, you’re right—al-Sarraj’s camp may be able to manage and sell its share if it manages to push further towards Sirte. But let’s not forget that Haftar was once in the same position before ultimately losing Sirte himself. He still controls many oil fields and has operated under this sort of power balance before. He remains in command of the largest portion of the country.

Before declaring him “finished”, a bit more caution and patience are warranted. It’s true that Russia’s Foreign Minister, Sergey Lavrov, recently appeared to shift focus towards Aguila Saleh—the Speaker of the Tobruk-based parliament and Egypt’s “Plan B”—but Saleh controls no military force. And Lavrov’s word is not the only one that counts. This reminds me of the Syrian case: the Russian foreign ministry may support one figure, while the Kremlin or the defence ministry—both more influential—back another.

I recall, for instance, that Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov once entertained the return of Saif al-Islam, Muammar Gaddafi’s son, to power in Libya. Yet Moscow continued supporting Field Marshal Haftar. We will not see a unified Libya any time soon. In my view, neither al-Sarraj nor Haftar is capable of achieving victory—neither through political means, which have failed, nor militarily, as recent developments have shown.

The status quo holds. Two opposing camps remain, each propped up by its own set of international patrons. I see no resolution in the medium term, because—as in Syria—no external sponsor or local actor genuinely trusts the others, especially within the framework of the UN, French, or other negotiations, which have thus far proved ineffective. In my opinion, only the Kremlin—and specifically Russia’s National Security Council—could put forward a truly viable solution.

<b>What about Haftar himself?</b>

Haftar is not only still a key player—he is actively preparing the next generation. He is grooming his son, al-Sadiq, and assembling a team of capable individuals around him.

He has a long-term vision for Libya, not merely a short-term strategy. He is gradually establishing a proper leadership structure. As for Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, I see no real future for him. He is surrounded by people who seem disconnected from the current realities. He commands no army and wields no significant power on the ground.

Moreover, the tribes that supposedly “elected” him are notoriously fickle—both in Libya and elsewhere. Tribal loyalties tend to shift towards whoever appears strongest at the moment, the one most likely to serve their immediate interests.

<b>On that note, how do you respond to the recent Russian constitutional reform that, following the “Kazakh model”, could allow Vladimir Putin to remain in power almost indefinitely?</b>

Frankly, if he remains in power, that’s a domestic matter. I don’t judge it, nor do I see why it should automatically be condemned—particularly if the reform was adopted through legitimate legal procedures.

The West—or certain Western countries—unfortunately has a tendency to pass constant judgement, dispensing moral and democratic lessons, and positioning itself as the self-appointed referee of the world. That approach is no longer acceptable in today’s multipolar world.

What we need is an international system composed of multiple centres of power. It’s unhealthy to have only one dominant arbiter—especially the United States—without counterweights. In a less American- and Western-centric world order, countries would be freer to develop, grow, and pursue their own models. Let me put it this way: systems of political power are like markets. Monopolies are never healthy. Competition between models forces each one to adapt, innovate, and improve.
