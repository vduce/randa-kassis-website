**Syria: The Threat of Chemical Weapons.** _France 5_ – C dans l’air 22 July 2012 Presented by Yves Calvi Guests: Antoine Sfeir, Jean-Marie Quéméner, Pierre Servent & Randa Kassis

**Summary:**

The broadcast featured a robust debate among the guests concerning the trajectory of the Syrian uprising, the legitimacy and composition of the armed opposition, and the risks posed by the proliferation of extremist groups. While some analysts focused on the brutality of the Assad regime and the urgent need to support the opposition, others raised concerns about the fragmented nature of the rebel forces and the influence of foreign powers. Questions were also raised regarding the international community’s selective engagement, the balance of military power, and the implications of a prolonged civil conflict.

Randa Kassis firmly drew attention to what she described as a dangerous and overlooked reality: the Syrian opposition—particularly the Free Syrian Army—was increasingly infiltrated by Islamist groups, including jihadists.

She warned that the original goals of the revolution—democracy, secularism, and human rights—were being eclipsed by the rise of radical Islamist ideologies.

Kassis emphasised that many of these fighters were not seeking freedom for all Syrians, but rather aimed to establish an Islamic state, posing a serious threat to minorities, women, and civil liberties.

She criticised the international community for turning a blind eye to this development, noting that unchecked support for the armed opposition risked empowering extremists who would merely replace one form of tyranny with another.

She also alerted the international community to the growing presence of jihadists in Syria, warning that the country risked becoming a new battleground for global jihad.
