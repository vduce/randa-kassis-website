<h4>Conference for Peace in Syria: Saudi Arabia’s Double Game</h4>

Syrian anthropologist and opposition figure Randa Kassis is the founder of the Movement for a Pluralistic Society and a former member of the Syrian National Council. As negotiations between the Syrian regime and the opposition continue to falter, she offers her perspective on the failures of Geneva, the role of minorities, and the dangers of regional interference.

<b>You supported the Geneva II Conference while lamenting the absence of minority and moderate leaders. What is your position today?</b>

My position remains both clear and nuanced. Yes, I support Geneva II—as I have consistently advocated for a political solution rather than the military approaches adopted by both sides. Military strategies have led nowhere and only deepen the humanitarian catastrophe. The one positive element of this conference—jointly promoted by Russia and the United States—is that it may, even in limited ways, help reduce the bloodshed. In my view, even modest progress on humanitarian aid is a vital step forward. What matters most is saving lives—particularly through humanitarian corridors, which can only be secured through negotiation with the regime in place.

That said, the greatest shortcoming of Geneva II lies in the fact that the delegation purportedly representing the opposition in reality represents only itself—not the wider opposition. The so-called “Syrian National Coalition,” which controls no territory on the ground, is little more than a façade. It is a minority force backed by Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Qatar, and conceals the actual forces operating within Syria: radical Islamists and jihadists who boycotted the conference and remain outside any structure of control.

This coalition does not prioritise the fate of Syria’s minorities or victims; instead, it fixates on unrealistic demands—chief among them the immediate departure of Assad—thereby blocking any meaningful progress. I believe we must begin with what is feasible: facilitating humanitarian access, addressing the issue of detainees, and taking concrete steps towards reconciliation. For example, reaching out to the Alawite community—which I believe is the only faction capable of replacing Bashar al-Assad—could yield far more tangible results. We must not repeat the fatal errors made in Iraq by dismantling the semi-secular ruling party and marginalising the ruling community, only to empower Islamist forces.

<b>You are critical of the National Coalition, yet they did agree to attend Geneva II.</b>

Yes, but no other major opposition force was included. The Coalition has no credibility on the ground. Its few affiliated militias do not even represent the broader Islamic Front, which had demanded to send its own representatives outside the Coalition framework. In the end, only the Coalition, a few vague rebel leaders, and isolated and unrepresentative Christian, Druze, and Alawite individuals were granted the status of “opposition representatives.”

The Coalition does not reflect the will of the Syrian people or the effective opposition. As for the armed groups, it is Saudi Arabia that funds them—these fighters serve Riyadh’s strategic interests more than those of the Syrian population, which remains hostage to thousands of foreign jihadists.

<b>Why is Saudi Arabia funding jihadist groups while promoting an image of moderation?</b>

The Saudis are playing a duplicitous game. They use forums like Geneva to present a moderate façade—especially since the Coalition includes a few minority members (Alawites, Christians, Kurds, Druze). Yet, behind the scenes, they continue to fund radical Islamist factions. Saudi Arabia is the only regional actor capable of sustaining the most extreme groups on the ground, especially those of Salafist-jihadist orientation.

If power were handed to the Coalition today, radical Islamists would quickly take the presidential palace in Damascus. Those within the Coalition who claim to represent “moderate Islamism,” alongside genuinely moderate but isolated individuals, are merely serving as window dressing.

The true goal is to install a Sunni Islamist regime aligned with Saudi interests. But Riyadh is deluded if it believes it can control the very radicals it sponsors. Let us not forget: Osama bin Laden was empowered during the Cold War in Afghanistan by the head of Saudi intelligence, Prince Turki al-Faisal—yet Saudi Arabia later found itself unable to contain al-Qaeda, which turned against them.

History is repeating itself. Money is not enough to control fanatics driven by a totalitarian ideology that respects only power and feeds on hatred. I predict that once empowered, these Islamist movements will turn on Saudi Arabia itself—whether linked to al-Qaeda or not, they are all rooted in the Wahhabi-Salafist movement championed by Riyadh. The Saudis support the most extreme Salafist groups to counter the Shia, particularly in Syria and Iraq, but this strategy is ultimately self-destructive.

<b>What is your view of the Alawites and the Ba’athist regime?</b>

I am convinced that Assad cannot be overthrown without engaging with certain regime elements—and that they must not be excluded. Nor can any political transition occur without involving his own community, with whom some form of compromise is essential. This could involve constitutional guarantees or political concessions, such as maintaining sovereign ministries—Defence, Interior—under Alawite authority in a future government. I believe the process must be gradual and structured. Geneva II was only the beginning.

<b>Not Geneva I?</b>

No—because Geneva I failed to recognise Russia as a central actor, which made the entire process unviable. Without agreement between Moscow and Washington, Geneva I was doomed. Moreover, there was no official regime delegation present, which made progress on essential humanitarian issues—such as establishing aid corridors—impossible.

By contrast, Geneva II was the first time since the beginning of the conflict that both principal actors—the Coalition and the regime—sat at the same table. It is only a beginning, but I maintain: no solution is possible without engaging the regime and its international allies, especially Russia and Iran.
