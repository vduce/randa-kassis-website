**Russia Will Not Back Down, and Western Sanctions Have So Far Funded Its War in Ukraine…** _Valeurs Actuelles_ 20 May 2022 By Alexandre del Valle

An Exclusive and Unorthodox Interview with Randa Kassis, Syrian Opposition Figure and Expert on Russian Foreign Policy.

**What about the sanctions? They don’t seem to be working as Western powers intended, but shouldn’t they have a devastating effect on the Russian economy within a few months, if a gas and oil embargo is imposed?**

We must distinguish between the various impacts sanctions may have. A ban on Russian oil, in general, would have a relatively limited effect on the Russian economy, as it is relatively easy for Russia to redirect its exports to Asia—particularly to China and India—within a short timeframe. Moreover, it’s likely that any European ban would be implemented gradually, not abruptly allowing Moscow time to adjust.

A strict embargo on gas, however, would be significantly more problematic. Yet such a move would border on economic suicide Europe, which currently has no viable alternative. Replacing 155 billion cubic metres of imported Russian gas would take years, regardless of what Mrs von der Leyen may claim. For instance, 90% of Qatar’s gas exports are locked into long-term contracts with Asian buyers. Algeria, after its agreement with Italy, has little spare capacity, with outdated infrastructure that has seen minimal investment over the past three decades. Azerbaijan can increase its supply only marginally, as the pipeline from the Caspian holds a capacity of just 19 billion cubic metres. As for Americans shale gas, it is extremely costly, and there is a shortage of around 300 LNG carriers required to transport it to Europe on a large scale.

In short, we could debate endlessly in search of a viable short-term alternative, but quite simply, none exists—neither in the short nor even the medium term.

**Can Europe Afford a Total Embargo on Russian Energy, as Demanded by the United States and the United Kingdom?**

For the United States and the United Kingdom, it is relatively easy to grandstand and pressure the European Union into what could prove a strategic misstep, given that they are far less dependent on Russian energy than their “allies” on the continent. One might even suspect that their objective is not solely to weaken Russia, but also to undermine Europe itself.

In reality, a total ban on Russian gas is utterly unfeasible. As for an embargo on Russian oil in the near term—pushed by the US and the UK, both of which are not reliant on Russian gas—this remains extremely difficult to enforce swiftly and is already exacerbating internal divisions within the EU. It is worth recalling that Slovakia, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Austria initially requested a delay of at least eight months during negotiations over the sixth sanctions package, as their dependency made immediate implementation economically untenable.

These same states, which recently obstructed the adoption of swift and comprehensive sanctions on Russian oil, illustrate that a full embargo is structurally near-impossible without inflicting serious damage on the European economy. Furthermore, Charles Michel’s suggestion to pay Russia into a “frozen account” was categorically rejected by Moscow.

In my view, for numerous reasons, a total ban strictu sensu will not come to pass. True, such a move could cost Russia an estimated $15 billion per month in lost revenue—but it has already been vetoed by Hungary, which is demanding a four- to five-year delay and blocked the sixth sanctions package alongside two other highly dependent member states. Moreover, this type of embargo would likely drive oil prices up by 8 to 10 per cent in Europe and globally.

To put it bluntly: yes, supporting the Ukrainians is morally understandable. But the unspoken slogan seems to be: “Aid or suicide—you must choose.” From this perspective, the proposals advanced by Michel and especially by Mrs von der Leyen amount to nothing short of the economic euthanasia of Europe.

**You recently made a rather counterintuitive statement: “Sanctions are funding Russia’s war in Ukraine.” Could you elaborate?**

It’s quite straightforward: as gas and oil prices continue to rise, Russia is earning more revenue—even while exporting less. Paradoxically, recent months have seen a surge in Russia’s gas exports to China, reaching record revenue levels. Western economic analysts often overlook the fact that although Russian gas exports have fallen by 27% over the past two and a half months, Russia has not incurred financial losses. On the contrary, it continues to earn approximately $800 million per day. The very price hikes triggered by the war and the sanctions have, in effect, generated greater income for Moscow.

This reality is further reinforced by a strategic move from Elvira Nabiullina, Governor of the Russian Central Bank, who structurally tied the rouble to hydrocarbons through the “roublisation” of energy payments, and to gold by establishing a fixed rouble–gold parity. This manoeuvre enabled the rouble to rebound to levels even higher than before the crisis.

**But Western countries refused to pay for energy in roubles, and the EU began a progressive embargo on Russian oil and gas, didn’t it?**

The EU did officially declare that it would not pay in roubles. However, countries such as Hungary, Austria, and Slovakia refused to comply. So, what is stopping private German firms—or those from other highly dependent European nations—from purchasing energy in roubles? Who is genuinely enforcing the ban? In practice, one can acquire roubles in China or through other international channels, or even pay indirectly via Gazprombank, which simply converts euros or dollars into roubles to complete transactions with Gazprom. Thus, how can such a mechanism be truly and effectively banned? Furthermore, the “spot” contracts for Russian oil, which Europe aims to eliminate, can be redirected to Asian markets—particularly China and India, where demand remains insatiable. Yes, they purchase at preferential prices, but since global demand is not declining and producing countries are not increasing supply, Russia can afford to offer discounts to Asian and non-Western clients without suffering a drop in revenue—because prices remain elevated. OPEC has made it clear that it has no intention of boosting output.

At the same time, Saudi Arabia and other OPEC members’ refusal to raise production quotas keeps global energy prices high, allowing Russia to offset both the discounts it offers “friendly” countries and the increased transport costs.

As for so-called examples of “resistance” from Bulgaria and Poland—who refused to pay in roubles and consequently had their gas supplies cut—these countries lack optimal alternative sources. In response, we are depleting our own European energy reserves to supply them, despite the fact that they currently have no affordable or viable substitute for Russian oil and gas.

**What about the sixth package of EU sanctions, which includes the ban on Russian oil?**

The latest sanctions package—partially obstructed by Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, and Austria—includes a provision to ban the use of Russian-flagged ships by oil companies. However, this measure is largely unenforceable. Russian entities can simply operate through vessels registered under Cypriot, Maltese, or Greek flags. Given that maritime shipping is a vital source of income for these countries, they naturally opposed this element of the sanctions. Consequently, Russian oil continues to be transported using tankers from a range of nations.

Moreover, how exactly does one enforce a global ban on Russian vessels? While such restrictions might be applied within the jurisdictions of the United States, the European Union, South Korea, Japan, and Australia, they remain inapplicable across much of the world. In fact, roughly 80% of the global population does not support Ukraine in the conflict and is not participating in sanctions against Russia.
