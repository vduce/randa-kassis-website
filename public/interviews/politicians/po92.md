**Randa Kassis: ‘On the Ground, the Jihadists Are Fewer in Number but Better Organised’.** _Le Progrès_ 13 March 2013 By Ludovic Bassand

**The humanitarian situation is deteriorating by the day. How can the violence be brought to an end?**

The situation is catastrophic. Syrians are fighting simply to survive. They queue for hours just to buy a small amount of flour. People are dying every day. The only viable solution is a political one. There can be no military victory for any side. The international community must step up its efforts to secure a negotiated settlement.

**Does such a solution necessarily require the departure of Bashar al-Assad?**

There are individuals within the regime who are open to negotiation. Bashar al-Assad himself is extremely obstinate—almost autistic in his rigidity. He will not relinquish power easily. I do not foresee him stepping down before 2014, when his term ends. If negotiations begin now, 2014 is not far off. An agreement could be reached that allows Assad to step down at the end of his mandate.

**Unlike other opposition figures, you oppose arming the rebels. Why?**

Weapons will solve nothing; they will only fuel further violence. Sadly, we are witnessing a growing presence of jihadists within the opposition. They are not the most numerous, but they are certainly the best organised. Wherever territory is taken from the regime, they are the ones who seize control. The conflict has become a confrontation between two totalitarian ideologies.

**Your vision for resolving the conflict is not shared by all opposition groups. Do you believe you represent the majority of Syrians?**

No opposition figure can honestly claim to know what proportion of the population they represent. Our movement defends human rights, women’s rights, and the rights of minorities. We have networks and contacts across all of Syria’s communities.
