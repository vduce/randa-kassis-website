Ms Randa Kassis, President of the Movement for a Pluralistic Society and representative of the Syrian opposition, declared: 'We are discussing the assistance that Kazakhstan could offer in resolving the Syrian crisis, given its international stature and strong relations with numerous countries'.

She proposed that President Nursultan Nazarbayev join the opposition representativesâ€™ working group in Astana to help draft a roadmap.

'Based on that roadmap, we could then proceed to Moscow for a third conference and take concrete steps', Ms Kassis explained.

'Kazakhstan could serve as a bridge between all the organisations with diverging interests', she concluded. (Tengrinews.kz)
