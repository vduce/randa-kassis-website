The majority of the 30 Syrian opposition figures who met in Astana from 25 to 27 May issued a joint statement on 28 May, calling for the continued pursuit of political solutions to the protracted conflict in their country. They also expressed their gratitude to the Kazakh government for providing a conducive setting for this latest round of negotiations, and voiced hope that the Astana platform might evolve into a permanent and effective mechanism for developing a political settlement for Syria.

The meeting was convened in Astana following Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev’s acceptance of a proposal, made earlier in the spring, for Kazakhstan to assist in mediating talks on Syria’s civil war. After intense and complex negotiations, held at the Rixos President Astana Hotel, the participants issued a joint statement in Arabic on 28 May, titled The Astana Declaration for a Political Solution in Syria.

Among other points, the document cited the Geneva I principles—formulated at the 30 June 2012 conference in Switzerland—as the 'basis for any political settlement', while emphasising that the outcomes of the two rounds of talks held in Moscow must also be 'taken into account'. It underscored the need for “a gradual political transition of power through a provisional government of national accord” and condemned all forms of violence against civilians, as well as “all kinds of terrorist activities perpetrated by extremist groups”. The declaration also stressed the importance of holding accountable those responsible for war crimes committed during the ongoing conflict.

'The participants in the negotiations affirm their aspiration, shared by all Syrians, to establish a state of national unity based on freedom and equality for all citizens', the document stated. 'They expressed the view that Syria should become a nation for all its people, without division or discrimination on religious or ethnic grounds, and that loyalty to the state is a fundamental requirement for building a just society. To preserve Syria as a unified nation-state, radical change is necessary to decentralise power and enhance democratic pluralism, without privileging any religious or ethnic group'.

The participants also underscored the need for the withdrawal of all foreign fighters involved in the conflict, and for the restoration of the national army in line with the principles of national defence. Furthermore, they emphasised the need to implement all international resolutions concerning the cessation of funding and support for terrorism.

The declaration called for the release of all political prisoners and abductees. On the issue of refugees, it highlighted the necessity of specific regulatory measures to facilitate their return, alongside the presence of civil society and international organisations in affected areas to provide immediate humanitarian assistance.

Three prominent delegates held a joint press conference to present the document to the media and to offer their reflections on the talks. These were Syrian activist and human rights defender Ammar Abdulhamid; President of the Movement for a Pluralistic Society, Randa Kassis; and senior representative of the Syrian Kurdish community, Sarbast Nabi.

The speakers described the discussions in Astana as productive, and welcomed the agreement—reached by approximately two-thirds of participants—on key principles for resolving the Syrian conflict.

'For the first time, we reached concrete agreements and adopted a number of principles in the pursuit of peace in Syria', Nabi told some 50 reporters gathered at the Rixos.

According to Abdulhamid, 'this meeting may evolve into a broader platform for dialogue. In the future, we hope to involve other opposition groups'. He characterised the Astana discussions as 'an attempt to coordinate the positions of the opposition'.

'If we have the consent of Kazakhstan and President Nazarbayev invites us again, we would be willing to return to Astana and expand the circle of opposition figures participating in these talks', said Kassis, signalling openness to further intra-Syrian dialogue in the Kazakh capital.

Kazakhstan’s Foreign Minister, Erlan Idrissov, held a subsequent press conference in the same venue, where he welcomed the Syrian opposition’s efforts to find common ground. He noted that, prior to the talks, Kazakh diplomats had contacted all potential participants, including the National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces led by Khaled Khoja—arguably the largest secular opposition alliance to the Assad government.

'Our platform was not closed to anyone. We have maintained direct contact with the Syrian authorities, and I personally spoke with the Syrian Foreign Minister, Mr Muallem', said Idrissov.

He added that he would brief the United Nations Special Envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, on the outcomes of the talks. He also noted that both he and other Kazakh diplomats had consulted with their Russian, American, Saudi, Turkish, and Jordanian counterparts before the meeting, and would do so again afterwards.

Earlier, Kassis had cited Kazakhstan’s good relations with all external stakeholders in the Syrian crisis—and its lack of vested interests in the outcome—as important reasons for choosing Astana as the venue for these talks.

'We are not so naïve as to think that one, two, or even three meetings in Astana will resolve this most complex conflict. It is merely a small contribution to a broader collective effort', Idrissov remarked. He acknowledged that the Geneva and Moscow processes remain key platforms for international dialogue on Syria.

'Today, the entire world is anxiously observing developments in the Middle East', the Kazakh Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in its announcement prior to the talks. 'The situation in Syria has become one of the most acute crises globally and has long since exceeded the bounds of a regional issue. To resolve the crisis, efforts must be united. Kazakhstan supports ongoing initiatives by all interested parties, both within and outside Syria, under UN auspices, which aim to bring an end to violence and bloodshed, address the acute humanitarian catastrophe, and determine the country’s political future through dialogue and reconciliation'.

According to the Kazakh Foreign Ministry, its decision to host the meeting stemmed from 'deep concern over the humanitarian situation \[in Syria\] and a firm belief that the only resolution lies in peaceful means, to be determined solely by the Syrians themselves'.

'The very fact that these opposition talks are being held in Astana demonstrates the level of trust Kazakhstan enjoys as a neutral state genuinely committed to a peaceful solution for Syria', said Timur Shaimergenov, Deputy Director of the Astana-based Library of the First President–Leader of the Nation, in a statement to this newspaper on 25 May. 'Now in its fourth year, the conflict in Syria shows no real signs of abating. The core issue remains the lack of consensus—and the resulting infighting—among Syrian elites. This prolongs instability and leaves the conflict vulnerable to external manipulation', he argued.

According to the Kazakh analyst, 'What matters now is that Syria’s elites recognise that peace in their homeland lies firmly in their own hands. Let us hope that the successful precedent set by the Iran nuclear talks held in Kazakhstan two years ago might inspire a genuine intra-Syrian dialogue'.
