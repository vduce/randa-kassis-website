<h4>By the Blood of Syrians</h4>

France 5 – C dans l’air  
21 May 2013  
Presented by Yves Calvi  
Guests: Antoine Basbous, Pierre Servent, Randa Kassis & Ziad Majid  

<b>Summary:</b>

The debate aired on C dans l’air offered a nuanced analysis of the Syrian civil war, shedding light on its complex sectarian and geopolitical dimensions. Experts described the conflict as profoundly fragmented, with no clear military victor in sight. Assad’s regime—backed by Iran, Hezbollah, and Russia—was said to be pursuing a sectarian strategy aimed at retaining control over key territories, particularly the corridor linking Damascus to the Alawite coastal region. Meanwhile, the opposition remains deeply divided among Islamist, secular, liberal, and ethnic minority factions, impeding both military coordination and political representation.

The discussion underscored the proxy nature of the conflict, with regional powers such as Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar supporting various opposition groups, while Western states offer political backing—each pursuing divergent strategic interests. Russia’s support for Assad was linked to its naval presence in Tartus and broader regional ambitions. The humanitarian toll was emphasised, with over 100,000 deaths, millions displaced, and widespread destruction of urban infrastructure.

Randa Kassis considered the debate’s focus on Syria’s internal divisions and the complexity of achieving a political resolution to be its most accurate and grounded aspect. In her view, the opposition’s failure to form a cohesive political front—fragmented as it is among Islamists, secularists, liberals, and ethnic minorities—has long been the principal obstacle to meaningful negotiation. She agreed with the assessment that Syria is already effectively partitioned and views federal or decentralised models as far more realistic than nostalgic appeals to national unity. Kassis also shares the scepticism expressed regarding foreign intervention, believing that further militarisation or rushed external involvement would only deepen the chaos and empower extremist groups. What troubles her most, however, is the sheer scale of human suffering—the millions displaced, the cities reduced to rubble, and the sectarian fears that have taken deep root. Rather than assigning blame, she calls on Syrians to confront the country’s fragmented reality with honesty, clarity, and political courage.
