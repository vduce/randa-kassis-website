Interview with Randa Kassis, Franco-Syrian Anthropologist, Political Figure, Writer, and President of the Movement for a Pluralistic Society – A Leading Voice of Opposition to the Former Regime of Bashar al-Assad

**The Fall of Bashar al-Assad: The Rise of Islamist Power in Damascus and the Future of Russia’s Military Bases in Syria**

Randa Kassis, a Franco-Syrian anthropologist, writer and political figure, is the president of the Movement for a Pluralistic Society. A leading figure in the secular opposition to the former regime of Bashar al-Assad, she offers a perspective that is both unique and deeply informed by years of engagement with Syria’s political and diplomatic landscape. Her advocacy for pluralism and multiculturalism has shaped her political activities both within and beyond Syria.

Notably, Kassis co-chaired the delegation of the secular and democratic Syrian opposition at the Geneva talks. In 2015, she launched the Astana Platform, which repeatedly brought together Syrian opposition figures and laid the groundwork for the broader Astana negotiations. Through this initiative, she has engaged extensively with Russian, Turkish, Western and Gulf state officials.

In this interview with Atlantico, she offers an initial assessment of the sudden collapse of Bashar al-Assad’s regime and the troubling emergence of an Islamist alternative. She also examines the fate of Russia’s highly strategic military bases, which Moscow, it appears, did not choose to defend at all costs.

Kassis provides a particularly nuanced and informed view of Turkey’s position—shaped by her pivotal role in the Astana Platform. Under the Astana framework, Ankara had committed to restraining and disarming jihadist forces in north-western Syria. However, these same factions ultimately overwhelmed the regime’s positions. While some speak of betrayal, Kassis adopts a more measured stance.

Having participated in numerous rounds of Syrian negotiations, she has frequently interacted with senior political figures from Russia, Turkey, the West and the Gulf. Her testimony, while inevitably shaped by her political engagements, is underpinned by a deep understanding of diplomatic mechanisms and backchannel negotiations, giving her insights considerable weight.

**Is Abu Mohammad al-Joulani truly the leader of the rebels and so-called “former jihadists” (HTS; SNA) who overthrew Bashar al-Assad? And is he now in a position to assert the dominance of Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) over the Syrian National Army (SNA)?**

At present, he can easily assert his authority, as he is the most organised actor on the ground and possesses the administrative experience required to govern Idlib. That said, he will likely have to make certain concessions—not only to the SNA, but also to military brigades in the south. However, he will not cede any power to the political opposition, whether based in Istanbul or operating through other platforms such as mine. That being said, cooperation with him remains fraught. Despite being a complex figure, he was once affiliated with Daesh and later with Al-Qaeda. I am willing to acknowledge the possibility of ideological evolution, but it has yet to be demonstrated—particularly now that he exercises wide-reaching control over much of the territory beyond Idlib.

He will soon have to grapple with a significant funding crisis. Qatar alone—given that Turkey now relies exclusively on Qatari financing—cannot cover the operational costs of state administration, let alone reconstruction. It is also worth noting that Syria’s natural resources are currently concentrated in the Kurdish-controlled regions, further complicating the situation.

Finally, it is highly unlikely that Saudi Arabia or the United Arab Emirates will offer any meaningful financial assistance.

**How will the new regime approach the Alawite and Druze strongholds? Will these minority communities be able to resist attacks by Turkish-backed militias from the SNA and HTS?**

It is probable that these minorities will not be immediately targeted. However, is it truly conceivable that there will be no reprisals? I find that highly doubtful. Can he restrain every individual driven by a desire for vengeance? That seems improbable. While I do believe he will try to suppress unrest to consolidate his authority, that does not make him a man of peace.

One should also consider that his forces amount to no more than 30,000 men—a modest number to govern an entire country. He will likely attempt to incorporate elements of the current regular army, although that institution is in a precarious state. The extent to which he can trust its personnel is limited. The situation remains highly volatile, with numerous challenges yet to come.

**Do you reject the rumour that a deal between Vladimir Putin and Recep Tayyip Erdoğan—Ukraine in exchange for Syria—enabled the success of the Sunni rebels? Or were there other negotiations that led Putin to abandon Assad’s regime, such as an alleged deal with Maher al-Assad, who is said to have ordered the army not to resist?**

No, I do not believe any of those claims. Maher was likely one of the last to lay down arms and flee. As powerful as the Fourth Division may be, it could not withstand the combined assault of HTS and rebel forces—particularly after Iran had lost all confidence in Bashar al-Assad and, more importantly, in the Syrian army’s ability to hold the line.

Russia had already considerably reduced its military presence in Syria due to the ongoing war in Ukraine. President Putin quickly realised that Syrian forces were collapsing, often abandoning positions and leaving behind Russian military equipment. Understandably, he is furious with the Assad administration. Given such circumstances, how could Russia have salvaged Assad’s regime in such a short timeframe? It would have been an impossible undertaking.

As for Turkey, I remain convinced it did not fully orchestrate the offensive. It seems President Erdoğan, through intermediaries, warned Joulani not to enter the city of Hama. Nonetheless, Joulani appears to have ignored this instruction and acted independently, bolstered by tacit support from Qatar, his principal financial backer.

**Just a few days ago, you seemed to believe Joulani was signalling a rhetorical shift—adopting a more nationalistic tone. But at the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus, he celebrated “victory for the Islamic ummah”—a classic Islamist and jihadist theme—and his recent appointments have excluded outspoken figures from the external opposition. Does this suggest, in your view, that Joulani remains a true jihadist with a dangerous agenda for the pluralistic Syria you have long advocated?**

Until recently, I retained some hope. But I now have serious doubts about the extent of his pragmatism—particularly when one considers the composition of his brigades. The fall of Bashar al-Assad opened a window of opportunity, yet we now face formidable dangers.

**What is the fate of Russia’s military bases in Hmeimim and Tartus, located in the Alawite strongholds once loyal to Assad?**

On the night of 8 to 9 December, Russia began evacuating the Hmeimim base in earnest, without issuing any official statement. Both Tartus and Hmeimim were placed on high alert, despite no immediate threat, and a withdrawal plan was enacted. The aim seems to be a strategic redeployment to Tobruk, Libya, where Russia established a naval base in 2024 in territory controlled by the Haftar family.

The intention is to expand that installation into a major military base, potentially replacing Tartus and serving Russia’s strategic and logistical interests in Africa. Moreover, a strengthened Russian presence in Haftar-held territory would represent a direct counterweight to Joulani’s regime, which is likely to adopt a hostile stance. This reorientation may also upset the fragile political and military balance in Libya. Simultaneously, Iran will almost certainly increase its presence in Iraq. The Syrian conflict, along with its broader geopolitical repercussions, is far from over. Russia made the error of standing by Bashar al-Assad, who, as I have previously stated, was already a spent force.

**So is this the end of Russia’s presence in Syria, in favour of a new presence in the Arab and African world?**

Not entirely. This does not mark the end of Russia’s presence or influence in Syria. Abu Mohammad al-Joulani, the leader of Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), now faces the prospect of three adversarial powers: Israel, Russia and the United States—each of which may one day coordinate their efforts against his regime should it become a broader threat.

Israel has long conducted operations in Syria to neutralise perceived dangers to its national security. Russia, having historically aligned with Assad’s government, still holds strategic interests in the region. As for the United States, during President Donald Trump’s tenure, Washington pursued a vacillating policy towards Syria, alternating between disengagement and targeted intervention. While Trump was reluctant to increase US involvement, concerns over terrorism and regional stability could prompt renewed action. Joulani, therefore, must navigate an increasingly complex geopolitical environment in which these powers may ultimately align to curb his influence in Syria.
