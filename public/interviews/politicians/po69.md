<h4>Kazakhstan to Host Syria Talks. Is the Central Asian nation an ideal mediator for international disputes?</h4>

Kazakhstan is set to host talks on the Syrian crisis later this month, according to a report by Tengrinews, citing RIA Novosti, the Russian state news agency. The talks are scheduled to take place in Astana from 25 to 27 May.

In early April, opposition figure Randa Kassis stated during the Syria talks in Moscow that some opposition groups intended to explore the possibility of Kazakhstan participating in efforts to mediate the Syrian conflict. By late April, Kazakhstan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed that a number of Syrian opposition groups—unnamed at the time—had formally requested President Nursultan Nazarbayev to host negotiations. A delegation subsequently visited Astana on 27 April to pursue the proposal further.

These developments appear to have culminated in the formal scheduling of talks. However, it is too early for celebration. Previous peace efforts on Syria have yielded few tangible results, and Kazakhstan has itself postponed other diplomatic initiatives in recent months.

The Syria peace talks held in Moscow and Geneva have made little headway. Kazakhstan’s Foreign Minister, Erlan Idrissov, was quick to stress that his country has no intention of replacing existing platforms. The April talks in Moscow ended on a sour note, marred by infighting among opposition factions. Russia, widely regarded as a key ally of the Assad regime, casts a shadow over talks held on its soil. Several major actors in the Syrian conflict—including the National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces, recognised by Washington as a “legitimate representative” of the Syrian people—chose not to attend. The UN Special Envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, also declined to participate, despite having attended the earlier round in January. That meeting, however, produced little more than an agreement to reconvene.

The Islamic State, a central element of the Syrian conflict, has refused to take part in any peace negotiations.

Kazakhstan holds no illusions that the Astana talks will resolve the Syrian crisis. Nor does Kassis, who has clarified that the discussions will focus on humanitarian aid and an action plan aimed at conflict resolution. According to Tengrinews, she remarked: 'We will never be able to find a way out of the situation or reach an agreement with the Islamic State or Jabhat al-Nusra. But several disbanded officers have agreed to come to Astana'.

What, then, does Kazakhstan stand to gain? This is not the country’s first attempt to raise its diplomatic profile. At this stage, the act of hosting—rather than achieving a final resolution—is what matters most.

In 2010, Astana hosted the OSCE summit, which ended with difficulty. Disputes over language concerning frozen conflicts in the OSCE zone and the fallout from the WikiLeaks scandal delayed the closing press conference by more than half a day. After midnight, President Nazarbayev told reporters: 'The fact that I am speaking to you at 01:00 Astana time probably tells you that it was not easy to achieve consensus'.

In 2013, Kazakhstan hosted nuclear negotiations between the P5+1 and Iran in its former capital, Almaty. While these talks helped boost Kazakhstan’s diplomatic standing, their direct impact on the negotiations—which remain unresolved—is difficult to assess.

Earlier this year, Kazakhstan was due to host talks on the Ukraine crisis, but they were postponed amid reports of military mobilisation on both sides. Reports in February indicated that the leaders of Russia, Ukraine, Germany, and France remained interested in Astana as a venue, though no further announcements have been made.

Kazakhstan has cultivated a neutral image, and as political analyst Dosym Satpayev noted, 'It is not surprising that when conflicts arise in the post-Soviet space and beyond, Kazakhstan emerges as a kind of moderator'. The country enjoys good relations with Russia, China, the United States, and several European nations, making it—in some respects—an attractive diplomatic venue. Although it may not yet rival the stature of Geneva, it is steadily gaining ground.

Rustam Burnashev, another analyst quoted by Tengrinews, observed that Kazakhstan’s previous efforts—such as hosting the OSCE summit and the Iran talks—were not about peacemaking, but nevertheless, they propelled the country’s status'. In this sense, the forthcoming Syria talks, regardless of their outcomes, are in line with that ongoing trajectory.
